# Proverbs

## Chapter 1

### Introduction to the Book

> <a>1:1</a> The Proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
> <a>1:2</a> To learn wisdom and moral instruction,
> and to discern wise counsel.
> <a>1:3</a> To receive moral instruction in skillful living,
> in righteousness, justice, and equity.
> <a>1:4</a> To impart shrewdness to the morally naive,
> and a discerning plan to the young person.
> <a>1:5</a> (Let the wise also hear and gain instruction,
> and let the discerning acquire guidance!)
> <a>1:6</a> To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable,
> the sayings of the wise and their riddles.

### Introduction to the Theme of the Book

> <a>1:7</a> Fearing the Lord is the beginning of moral knowledge,
> but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
> <a>1:8</a> Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father,
> and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.
> <a>1:9</a> For they will be like an elegant garland on your head,
> and like pendants around your neck.

### Admonition to Avoid Easy but Unjust Riches

> <a>1:10</a> My child, if sinners try to entice you,
> do not consent!
> <a>1:11</a> If they say, “Come with us!
> We will lie in wait to shed blood;
> we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.
> <a>1:12</a> We will swallow them alive like Sheol,
> those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.
> <a>1:13</a> We will seize all kinds of precious wealth;
> we will fill our houses with plunder.
> <a>1:14</a> Join with us!
> We will all share equally in what we steal.”
> <a>1:15</a> My child, do not go down their way,
> withhold yourself from their path;
> <a>1:16</a> for they are eager to inflict harm,
> and they hasten to shed blood.
> <a>1:17</a> Surely it is futile to spread a net
> in view of any bird,
> <a>1:18</a> but these men lie in wait for their own blood,
> they ambush their own lives!
> <a>1:19</a> Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly;
> it takes away the life of those who obtain it.

### Warning Against Disregarding Wisdom

> <a>1:20</a> Wisdom calls out in the street,
> she shouts loudly in the plazas;
> <a>1:21</a> at the head of the noisy streets she calls,
> in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:
> <a>1:22</a> “How long will you simpletons love naiveté?
> How long will mockers delight in mockery
> and fools hate knowledge?
> <a>1:23</a> If only you will respond to my rebuke,
> then I will pour out my thoughts to you
> and I will make my words known to you.
> <a>1:24</a> However, because I called but you refused to listen,
> because I stretched out my hand but no one paid attention,
> <a>1:25</a> because you neglected all my advice,
> and did not comply with my rebuke,
> <a>1:26</a> so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you,
> I will mock when what you dread comes,
> <a>1:27</a> when what you dread comes like a whirlwind,
> and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm,
> when distressing trouble comes on you.
> <a>1:28</a> Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;
> they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.
> <a>1:29</a> Because they hated moral knowledge,
> and did not choose to fear the Lord,
> <a>1:30</a> they did not comply with my advice,
> they spurned all my rebuke.
> <a>1:31</a> Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way,
> and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.
> <a>1:32</a> For the waywardness of the simpletons will kill them,
> and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.
> <a>1:33</a> But the one who listens to me will live in security,
> and will be at ease from the dread of harm.

## Chapter 2

### Benefits of Seeking Wisdom

> <a>2:1</a> My child, if you receive my words,
> and store up my commands within you,
> <a>2:2</a> by making your ear attentive to wisdom,
> and by turning your heart to understanding,
> <a>2:3</a> indeed, if you call out for understanding,
> and raise your voice for understanding,
> <a>2:4</a> if you seek it like silver,
> and search for it like hidden treasure,
> <a>2:5</a> then you will understand how to fear the Lord,
> and you will discover knowledge about God.
> <a>2:6</a> For the Lord gives wisdom,
> and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
> <a>2:7</a> He stores up effective counsel for the upright,
> and is like a shield for those who live with integrity,
> <a>2:8</a> to guard the paths of the righteous
> and to protect the way of his pious ones.
> <a>2:9</a> Then you will understand righteousness and justice
> and equity—every good way.
> <a>2:10</a> For wisdom will enter your heart,
> and moral knowledge will be attractive to you.
> <a>2:11</a> Discretion will protect you,
> understanding will guard you,
> <a>2:12</a> to deliver you from the way of the wicked,
> from those speaking perversity,
> <a>2:13</a> who leave the upright paths
> to walk on the dark ways,
> <a>2:14</a> who delight in doing evil,
> they rejoice in perverse evil;
> <a>2:15</a> whose paths are morally crooked,
> and who are devious in their ways;
> <a>2:16</a> to deliver you from the adulteress,
> from the sexually loose woman who speaks flattering words;
> <a>2:17</a> who leaves the husband from her youth,
> and forgets her marriage covenant made before God.
> <a>2:18</a> For her house sinks down to death,
> and her paths lead to the place of the departed spirits.
> <a>2:19</a> None who go in to her will return,
> nor will they reach the paths of life.
> <a>2:20</a> So you will walk in the way of good people,
> and will keep on the paths of the righteous.
> <a>2:21</a> For the upright will reside in the land,
> and those with integrity will remain in it,
> <a>2:22</a> but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
> and the treacherous will be torn away from it.

## Chapter 3

### Exhortations to Seek Wisdom and Walk with the Lord

> <a>3:1</a> My child, do not forget my teaching,
> but let your heart keep my commandments,
> <a>3:2</a> for they will provide a long and full life,
> and they will add well-being to you.
> <a>3:3</a> Do not let truth and mercy leave you;
> bind them around your neck,
> write them on the tablet of your heart.
> <a>3:4</a> Then you will find favor and good understanding,
> in the sight of God and people.
> <a>3:5</a> Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
> and do not rely on your own understanding.
> <a>3:6</a> Acknowledge him in all your ways,
> and he will make your paths straight.
> <a>3:7</a> Do not be wise in your own estimation;
> fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
> <a>3:8</a> This will bring healing to your body,
> and refreshment to your inner self.
> <a>3:9</a> Honor the Lord from your wealth
> and from the first fruits of all your crops;
> <a>3:10</a> then your barns will be filled completely,
> and your vats will overflow with new wine.
> <a>3:11</a> My child, do not despise discipline from the Lord,
> and do not loathe his rebuke.
> <a>3:12</a> For the Lord disciplines those he loves,
> just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.

### Blessings of Obtaining Wisdom

> <a>3:13</a> Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,
> and the one who obtains understanding.
> <a>3:14</a> For her benefit is more profitable than silver,
> and her gain is better than gold.
> <a>3:15</a> She is more precious than rubies,
> and none of the things you desire can compare with her.
> <a>3:16</a> Long life is in her right hand;
> in her left hand are riches and honor.
> <a>3:17</a> Her ways are very pleasant,
> and all her paths are peaceful.
> <a>3:18</a> She is like a tree of life to those who obtain her,
> and everyone who grasps hold of her will be blessed.
> <a>3:19</a> The Lord by wisdom laid the foundation of the earth;
> he established the heavens by understanding.
> <a>3:20</a> By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open,
> and the clouds drip down dew.
> <a>3:21</a> My child, do not let them escape from your sight;
> safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.
> <a>3:22</a> So they will give life to you,
> and grace to adorn your neck.
> <a>3:23</a> Then you will walk on your way with security,
> and you will not stumble.
> <a>3:24</a> When you lie down you will not be filled with fear,
> and when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.
> <a>3:25</a> You will not be afraid of sudden disaster,
> or when destruction comes on the wicked;
> <a>3:26</a> for the Lord will be the source of your confidence,
> and he will guard your foot from being ensnared.

### Wisdom Demonstrated in Relationships with People

> <a>3:27</a> Do not withhold good from those who need it,
> when you have the ability to do it.
> <a>3:28</a> Do not say to your neighbor, “Go! Return tomorrow
> and I will give it”—when you have it with you at the time.
> <a>3:29</a> Do not plot evil against your neighbor
> when he dwells by you unsuspectingly.
> <a>3:30</a> Do not accuse anyone without legitimate cause,
> if he has not treated you wrongly.
> <a>3:31</a> Do not envy a violent man,
> and do not choose any of his ways;
> <a>3:32</a> for one who goes astray is an abomination to the Lord,
> but he reveals his intimate counsel to the upright.
> <a>3:33</a> The Lord’s curse is on the household of the wicked,
> but he blesses the home of the righteous.
> <a>3:34</a> Although he is scornful to arrogant scoffers,
> yet he shows favor to the humble.
> <a>3:35</a> The wise inherit honor,
> but he holds fools up to public contempt.

## Chapter 4

### Admonition to Follow Righteousness and Avoid Wickedness

> <a>4:1</a> Listen, children, to a father’s instruction,
> and pay attention so that you may gain discernment.
> <a>4:2</a> Because I give you good instruction,
> do not forsake my teaching.
> <a>4:3</a> When I was a son to my father,
> a tender only child before my mother,
> <a>4:4</a> he taught me, and he said to me:
> “Let your heart lay hold of my words;
> keep my commands so that you will live.
> <a>4:5</a> Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding;
> do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.
> <a>4:6</a> Do not forsake her, and she will protect you;
> love her, and she will guard you.
> <a>4:7</a> Wisdom is supreme—so acquire wisdom,
> and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding!
> <a>4:8</a> Esteem her highly and she will exalt you;
> she will honor you if you embrace her.
> <a>4:9</a> She will place a fair garland on your head;
> she will bestow a beautiful crown on you.”
> <a>4:10</a> Listen, my child, and accept my words,
> so that the years of your life will be many.
> <a>4:11</a> I will guide you in the way of wisdom
> and I will lead you in upright paths.
> <a>4:12</a> When you walk, your steps will not be hampered,
> and when you run, you will not stumble.
> <a>4:13</a> Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;
> protect it, because it is your life.
> <a>4:14</a> Do not enter the path of the wicked
> or walk in the way of those who are evil.
> <a>4:15</a> Avoid it, do not go on it;
> turn away from it, and go on.
> <a>4:16</a> For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm;
> they are robbed of sleep until they make someone fall.
> <a>4:17</a> For they eat bread gained from wickedness
> and drink wine obtained from violence.
> <a>4:18</a> But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light,
> growing brighter and brighter until full day.
> <a>4:19</a> The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness;
> they do not know what causes them to stumble.
> <a>4:20</a> My child, pay attention to my words;
> listen attentively to my sayings.
> <a>4:21</a> Do not let them depart from your sight,
> guard them within your heart;
> <a>4:22</a> for they are life to those who find them
> and healing to one’s entire body.
> <a>4:23</a> Guard your heart with all vigilance,
> for from it are the sources of life.
> <a>4:24</a> Remove perverse speech from your mouth;
> keep devious talk far from your lips.
> <a>4:25</a> Let your eyes look directly in front of you
> and let your gaze look straight before you.
> <a>4:26</a> Make the path for your feet level,
> so that all your ways may be established.
> <a>4:27</a> Do not turn to the right or to the left;
> turn yourself away from evil.

## Chapter 5

### Admonition to Avoid Seduction to Evil

> <a>5:1</a> My child, be attentive to my wisdom,
> pay close attention to my understanding,
> <a>5:2</a> in order to safeguard discretion,
> and that your lips may guard knowledge.
> <a>5:3</a> For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,
> and her seductive words are smoother than oil,
> <a>5:4</a> but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
> sharp as a two-edged sword.
> <a>5:5</a> Her feet go down to death;
> her steps lead straight to the grave.
> <a>5:6</a> Lest she should make level the path leading to life,
> her paths are unstable but she does not know it.
> <a>5:7</a> So now, children, listen to me;
> do not turn aside from the words I speak.
> <a>5:8</a> Keep yourself far from her,
> and do not go near the door of her house,
> <a>5:9</a> lest you give your vigor to others
> and your years to a cruel person,
> <a>5:10</a> lest strangers devour your strength,
> and your labor benefit another man’s house.
> <a>5:11</a> And at the end of your life you will groan
> when your flesh and your body are wasted away.
> <a>5:12</a> And you will say, “How I hated discipline!
> My heart spurned reproof!
> <a>5:13</a> For I did not obey my teachers
> and I did not heed my instructors.
> <a>5:14</a> I almost came to complete ruin
> in the midst of the whole congregation!”
> <a>5:15</a> Drink water from your own cistern
> and running water from your own well.
> <a>5:16</a> Should your springs be dispersed outside,
> your streams of water in the wide plazas?
> <a>5:17</a> Let them be for yourself alone,
> and not for strangers with you.
> <a>5:18</a> May your fountain be blessed,
> and may you rejoice in your young wife—
> <a>5:19</a> a loving doe, a graceful deer;
> may her breasts satisfy you at all times,
> may you be captivated by her love always.
> <a>5:20</a> But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,
> and embrace the bosom of a different woman?
> <a>5:21</a> For the ways of a person are in front of the eyes of the Lord,
> and the Lord weighs all that person’s paths.
> <a>5:22</a> The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities,
> and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.
> <a>5:23</a> He will die because there was no discipline;
> because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.

## Chapter 6

### Admonitions and Warnings against Dangerous and Destructive Acts

> <a>6:1</a> My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor,
> and have become a guarantor for a stranger,
> <a>6:2</a> if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered,
> and have been caught by the words you have spoken,
> <a>6:3</a> then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself,
> because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:
> go, humble yourself,
> and appeal firmly to your neighbor.
> <a>6:4</a> Do not give sleep to your eyes
> or slumber to your eyelids.
> <a>6:5</a> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare,
> and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.
> <a>6:6</a> Go to the ant, you sluggard;
> observe its ways and be wise!
> <a>6:7</a> It has no commander,
> overseer, or ruler,
> <a>6:8</a> yet it prepares its food in the summer;
> it gathers at the harvest what it will eat.
> <a>6:9</a> How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?
> When will you rise from your sleep?
> <a>6:10</a> A little sleep, a little slumber,
> a little folding of the hands to relax,
> <a>6:11</a> and your poverty will come like a robber,
> and your need like an armed man.
> <a>6:12</a> A worthless and wicked person
> walks around saying perverse things;
> <a>6:13</a> he winks with his eyes,
> signals with his feet,
> and points with his fingers;
> <a>6:14</a> he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart,
> he spreads contention at all times.
> <a>6:15</a> Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;
> in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.
> <a>6:16</a> There are six things that the Lord hates,
> even seven things that are an abomination to him:
> <a>6:17</a> haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
> and hands that shed innocent blood,
> <a>6:18</a> a heart that devises wicked plans,
> feet that are swift to run to evil,
> <a>6:19</a> a false witness who pours out lies,
> and a person who spreads discord among family members.
> <a>6:20</a> My child, guard the commands of your father
> and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
> <a>6:21</a> Bind them on your heart continually;
> fasten them around your neck.
> <a>6:22</a> When you walk about, they will guide you;
> when you lie down, they will watch over you;
> when you wake up, they will talk to you.
> <a>6:23</a> For the commandments are like a lamp,
> instruction is like a light,
> and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,
> <a>6:24</a> by keeping you from the evil woman,
> from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.
> <a>6:25</a> Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,
> and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
> <a>6:26</a> for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,
> but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.
> <a>6:27</a> Can a man hold fire against his chest
> without burning his clothes?
> <a>6:28</a> Can a man walk on hot coals
> without scorching his feet?
> <a>6:29</a> So it is with the one who has sex with his neighbor’s wife;
> no one who touches her will escape punishment.
> <a>6:30</a> People do not despise a thief when he steals
> to fulfill his need when he is hungry.
> <a>6:31</a> Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over,
> he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.
> <a>6:32</a> A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks wisdom,
> whoever does it destroys his own life.
> <a>6:33</a> He will be beaten and despised,
> and his reproach will not be wiped away;
> <a>6:34</a> for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,
> and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.
> <a>6:35</a> He will not consider any compensation;
> he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.

## Chapter 7

### Admonition to Avoid the Wiles of the Adulteress

> <a>7:1</a> My child, keep my words
> and treasure up my commands within your own keeping.
> <a>7:2</a> Keep my commands so that you may live,
> and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.
> <a>7:3</a> Bind them on your forearm;
> write them on the tablet of your heart.
> <a>7:4</a> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
> and call understanding a close relative,
> <a>7:5</a> so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman,
> from the loose woman who flatters you with her words.
> <a>7:6</a> For at the window of my house
> through my window-lattice I looked out
> <a>7:7</a> and I saw among the naive,
> I discerned among the youths,
> a young man who lacked wisdom.
> <a>7:8</a> He was passing by the street near her corner,
> making his way along the road to her house
> <a>7:9</a> in the twilight, the evening,
> in the dark of the night.
> <a>7:10</a> All of a sudden a woman came out to meet him!
> She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.
> <a>7:11</a> (She is loud and rebellious,
> she does not remain at home—
> <a>7:12</a> at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas,
> and by every corner she lies in wait.)
> <a>7:13</a> So she grabbed him and kissed him,
> and with a bold expression she said to him,
> <a>7:14</a> “I have fresh meat at home;
> today I have fulfilled my vows!
> <a>7:15</a> That is why I came out to meet you,
> to look for you, and I found you!
> <a>7:16</a> I have spread my bed with elegant coverings,
> with richly colored fabric from Egypt.
> <a>7:17</a> I have perfumed my bed
> with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
> <a>7:18</a> Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning,
> let’s delight ourselves with sexual intercourse.
> <a>7:19</a> For my husband is not at home;
> he has gone on a journey of some distance.
> <a>7:20</a> He has taken a bag of money with him;
> he will not return until the end of the month.”
> <a>7:21</a> She persuaded him with persuasive words;
> with her smooth speech she compelled him.
> <a>7:22</a> Suddenly he went after her
> like an ox that goes to the slaughter,
> like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare
> <a>7:23</a> till an arrow pierces his liver—
> like a bird hurrying into a trap,
> and he does not know that it will cost him his life.
> <a>7:24</a> So now, sons, listen to me,
> and pay attention to the words I speak.
> <a>7:25</a> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways;
> do not wander into her pathways;
> <a>7:26</a> for she has brought down many fatally wounded,
> and all those she has slain are many.
> <a>7:27</a> Her house is the way to the grave,
> going down to the chambers of death.

## Chapter 8

### The Appeal Of Wisdom

> <a>8:1</a> Does not wisdom call out?
> Does not understanding raise her voice?
> <a>8:2</a> At the top of the elevated places along the way,
> at the juncture of the paths she takes her stand;
> <a>8:3</a> beside the gates opening into the city,
> at the entrance of the doorways she cries out:
> <a>8:4</a> “To you, O people, I call out,
> and my voice calls to all mankind.
> <a>8:5</a> You who are naive, discern wisdom!
> And you fools, understand discernment!
> <a>8:6</a> Listen, for I will speak excellent things,
> and my lips will utter what is right.
> <a>8:7</a> For my mouth speaks truth,
> and my lips hate wickedness.
> <a>8:8</a> All the words of my mouth are righteous;
> there is nothing in them twisted or crooked.
> <a>8:9</a> All of them are clear to the discerning
> and upright to those who find knowledge.
> <a>8:10</a> Receive my instruction rather than silver,
> and knowledge rather than choice gold.
> <a>8:11</a> For wisdom is better than rubies,
> and desirable things cannot be compared to her.
> <a>8:12</a> “I, wisdom, live with prudence,
> and I find knowledge and discretion.
> <a>8:13</a> The fear of the Lord is to hate evil;
> I hate arrogant pride and the evil way
> and perverse utterances.
> <a>8:14</a> Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me;
> I possess understanding and might.
> <a>8:15</a> Kings reign by means of me,
> and potentates decree righteousness;
> <a>8:16</a> by me princes rule,
> as well as nobles and all righteous judges.
> <a>8:17</a> I love those who love me,
> and those who seek me find me.
> <a>8:18</a> Riches and honor are with me,
> long-lasting wealth and righteousness.
> <a>8:19</a> My fruit is better than pure gold,
> and what I produce is better than choice silver.
> <a>8:20</a> I walk in the path of righteousness,
> in the midst of the pathway of justice,
> <a>8:21</a> that I may cause those who love me to inherit righteousness,
> and fill their treasuries.
> <a>8:22</a> The Lord created me as the beginning of his way,
> before his works of old.
> <a>8:23</a> From eternity I was appointed,
> from the beginning, from before the world existed.
> <a>8:24</a> When there were no deep oceans I was given birth,
> when there were no springs abounding with water;
> <a>8:25</a> before the mountains were settled,
> before the hills, I was brought forth,
> <a>8:26</a> before he made the earth and its fields,
> or the beginning of the dust of the world.
> <a>8:27</a> When he established the heavens, I was there;
> when he marked out the horizon over the face of the deep,

### The Consequences of Accepting Wisdom or Folly

> <a>9:1</a> Wisdom has built her house;
> she has carved out its seven pillars.
> <a>9:2</a> She has prepared her meat, she has mixed her wine;
> she also has arranged her table.
> <a>9:3</a> She has sent out her female servants;
> she calls out on the highest places of the city.
> <a>9:4</a> “Whoever is naive, let him turn in here,”
> she says to those who lack understanding.
> <a>9:5</a> “Come, eat some of my food,
> and drink some of the wine I have mixed.
> <a>9:6</a> Abandon your foolish ways so that you may live,
> and proceed in the way of understanding.”
> <a>9:7</a> Whoever corrects a mocker is asking for insult;
> whoever reproves a wicked person receives abuse.
> <a>9:8</a> Do not reprove a mocker or he will hate you;
> reprove a wise person and he will love you.
> <a>9:9</a> Give instruction to a wise person, and he will become wiser still;
> teach a righteous person and he will add to his learning.
> <a>9:10</a> The beginning of wisdom is to fear the Lord,
> and acknowledging the Holy One is understanding.
> <a>9:11</a> For because of me your days will be many,
> and years will be added to your life.
> <a>9:12</a> If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage,
> but if you are a mocker, you alone must bear it.
> <a>9:13</a> The woman called Folly is brash,
> she is naive and does not know anything.
> <a>9:14</a> So she sits at the door of her house,
> on a seat at the highest point of the city,
> <a>9:15</a> calling out to those who are passing by her in the way,
> who go straight on their way.
> <a>9:16</a> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here,”
> she says to those who lack understanding.
> <a>9:17</a> “Stolen waters are sweet,
> and food obtained in secret is pleasant!”
> <a>9:18</a> But they do not know that the dead are there,
> that her guests are in the depths of the grave.

> but a wise person appeases it.
> <a>16:15</a> In the light of the king’s face there is life,
> and his favor is like the clouds of the spring rain.
> <a>16:16</a> How much better it is to acquire wisdom than gold;
> to acquire understanding is more choice than silver.
> <a>16:17</a> The highway of the upright is to turn away from evil;
> the one who guards his way safeguards his life.
> <a>16:18</a> Pride goes before destruction,
> and a haughty spirit before a fall.
> <a>16:19</a> It is better to be lowly in spirit with the afflicted
> than to share the spoils with the proud.
> <a>16:20</a> The one who deals wisely in a matter will find success,
> and blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord.
> <a>16:21</a> The one who is wise in heart is called discerning,
> and the kind speech increases persuasiveness.
> <a>16:22</a> Insight is like a life-giving fountain to the one who has wisdom,
> but folly leads to the discipline of fools.
> <a>16:23</a> The heart of a wise person makes his speech wise
> and it adds persuasiveness to his words.
> <a>16:24</a> Pleasant words are like a honeycomb,
> sweet to the heart and healing to the bones.
> <a>16:25</a> There is a way that seems right to a person,
> but its end is the way of death.
> <a>16:26</a> The appetite of a laborer works on his behalf,
> for his hunger urges him to work.
> <a>16:27</a> A wicked scoundrel digs up evil,
> and his slander is like a scorching fire.
> <a>16:28</a> A perverse person spreads dissension,
> and a gossip separates close friends.
> <a>16:29</a> A violent person entices his neighbor,
> and leads him down a path that is terrible.
> <a>16:30</a> The one who winks his eyes devises perverse things,
> and one who compresses his lips brings about evil.
> <a>16:31</a> Gray hair is like a crown of glory;
> it is attained in the path of righteousness.
> <a>16:32</a> Better to be slow to anger than to be a mighty warrior,
> and one who rules his temper is better than one who captures a city.
> <a>16:33</a> The dice are thrown into the lap,
> but every decision is from the Lord.

## Chapter 17

> <a>17:1</a> Better is a dry crust of bread where there is quietness
> than a house full of feasting with strife.
> <a>17:2</a> A servant who acts wisely will rule over an heir who behaves shamefully,
> and will share the inheritance along with the relatives.
> <a>17:3</a> The crucible is for refining silver and the furnace is for gold,
> likewise the Lord tests hearts.
> <a>17:4</a> One who acts wickedly pays attention to evil counsel;
> a liar listens to a malicious tongue.
> <a>17:5</a> The one who mocks the poor insults his Creator;
> whoever rejoices over disaster will not go unpunished.
> <a>17:6</a> Grandchildren are like a crown to the elderly,
> and the glory of children is their parents.
> <a>17:7</a> Excessive speech is not becoming for a fool;
> how much less are lies for a ruler.
> <a>17:8</a> A bribe works like a charm for the one who offers it;
> in whatever he does he succeeds.
> <a>17:9</a> The one who forgives an offense seeks love,
> but whoever repeats a matter separates close friends.
> <a>17:10</a> A rebuke makes a greater impression on a discerning person
> than a hundred blows on a fool.
> <a>17:11</a> An evil person seeks only rebellion,
> and so a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
> <a>17:12</a> It is better for a person to encounter a mother bear being robbed of her cubs,
> than to meet a fool in his folly.
> <a>17:13</a> As for the one who repays evil for good,
> evil will not leave his house.
> <a>17:14</a> Starting a quarrel is like letting out water;
> stop it before strife breaks out!
> <a>17:15</a> The one who acquits the guilty and condemns the innocent—
> both of them are an abomination to the Lord.
> <a>17:16</a> Of what use is money in the hand of a fool,
> since he has no intention of acquiring wisdom?
> <a>17:17</a> A friend loves at all times,
> and a relative is born to help in adversity.
> <a>17:18</a> The one who lacks wisdom strikes hands in pledge,
> and puts up financial security for his neighbor.
> <a>17:19</a> The one who loves a quarrel loves transgression;
> whoever builds his gate high seeks destruction.
> <a>17:20</a> The one who has a perverse heart does not find good,
> and the one who is deceitful in speech falls into trouble.
> <a>17:21</a> Whoever brings a fool into the world does so to his grief,
> and the father of a fool has no joy.
> <a>17:22</a> A cheerful heart brings good healing,
> but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
> <a>17:23</a> A wicked person receives a bribe secretly
> to pervert the ways of justice.
> <a>17:24</a> Wisdom is before the discerning person,
> but the eyes of a fool run to the end of the earth.
> <a>17:25</a> A foolish child is a grief to his father,
> and bitterness to the mother who bore him.
> <a>17:26</a> It is terrible to punish a righteous person,
> and to strike honorable men is wrong.
> <a>17:27</a> The wise person restrains his words,
> and the one who stays calm is a discerning person.
> <a>17:28</a> Even a fool who remains silent is considered wise,
> and the one who holds his tongue is deemed discerning.

## Chapter 18

> <a>18:1</a> One who has isolated himself seeks his own desires;
> he rejects all sound judgment.
> <a>18:2</a> A fool takes no pleasure in understanding
> but only in disclosing what is on his mind.
> <a>18:3</a> When a wicked person arrives, contempt shows up with him,
> and with shame comes a reproach.
> <a>18:4</a> The words of a person’s mouth are like deep waters,
> and the fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.
> <a>18:5</a> It is terrible to show partiality to the wicked,
> by depriving a righteous man of justice.
> <a>18:6</a> The lips of a fool enter into strife,
> and his mouth invites a flogging.
> <a>18:7</a> The mouth of a fool is his ruin,
> and his lips are a snare for his life.
> <a>18:8</a> The words of a gossip are like choice morsels;
> they go down into the person’s innermost being.
> <a>18:9</a> The one who is slack in his work
> is a brother to one who destroys.
> <a>18:10</a> The name of the Lord is like a strong tower;
> the righteous person runs to it and is set safely on high.
> <a>18:11</a> The wealth of a rich person is like a strong city,
> and it is like a high wall in his imagination.
> <a>18:12</a> Before destruction the heart of a person is proud,
> but humility comes before honor.
> <a>18:13</a> The one who gives an answer before he listens—
> that is his folly and his shame.
> <a>18:14</a> A person’s spirit sustains him in sickness—
> but who can bear a crushed spirit?
> <a>18:15</a> The discerning person acquires knowledge,
> and the wise person seeks knowledge.
> <a>18:16</a> A person’s gift makes room for him,
> and leads him before great people.
> <a>18:17</a> The first to state his case seems right,
> until his opponent comes and cross-examines him.
> <a>18:18</a> A toss of a coin ends disputes,
> and settles the issue between strong opponents.
> <a>18:19</a> A relative offended is harder to reach than a strong city,
> and disputes are like the bars of a fortified citadel.
> <a>18:20</a> From the fruit of a person’s mouth his stomach is satisfied,
> with the product of his lips is he satisfied.
> <a>18:21</a> Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
> and those who love its use will eat its fruit.
> <a>18:22</a> The one who finds a wife finds what is enjoyable,
> and receives a pleasurable gift from the Lord.
> <a>18:23</a> A poor person makes supplications,
> but a rich man answers harshly.
> <a>18:24</a> A person who has friends may be harmed by them,
> but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

## Chapter 19

> <a>19:1</a> Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity
> than one who is perverse in his speech and is a fool.
> <a>19:2</a> It is dangerous to have zeal without knowledge,
> and the one who acts hastily makes poor choices.
> <a>19:3</a> A person’s folly subverts his way,
> and his heart rages against the Lord.
> <a>19:4</a> Wealth adds many friends,
> but a poor person is separated from his friend.
> <a>19:5</a> A false witness will not go unpunished,
> and the one who pours out lies will not escape punishment.
> <a>19:6</a> Many people entreat the favor of a generous person,
> and everyone is the friend of the one who gives gifts.
> <a>19:7</a> All the relatives of a poor person hate him;
> how much more do his friends go far from him—
> he pursues them with words, but they do not respond.
> <a>19:8</a> The one who acquires wisdom loves himself;
> the one who preserves understanding will prosper.
> <a>19:9</a> A false witness will not go unpunished,
> and the one who pours out lies will perish.
> <a>19:10</a> Luxury is not appropriate for a fool;
> how much less for a servant to rule over princes!
> <a>19:11</a> A person’s wisdom makes him slow to anger,
> and it is his glory to overlook an offense.
> <a>19:12</a> A king’s wrath is like the roar of a lion,
> but his favor is like dew on the grass.
> <a>19:13</a> A foolish child is the ruin of his father,
> and a contentious wife is like a constant dripping.
> <a>19:14</a> A house and wealth are the inheritance from parents,
> but a prudent wife is from the Lord.
> <a>19:15</a> Laziness brings on a deep sleep,
> and the idle person will go hungry.
> <a>19:16</a> The one who obeys commandments guards his life;
> the one who despises his ways will die.
> <a>19:17</a> The one who is gracious to the poor lends to the Lord,
> and the Lord will repay him for his good deed.
> <a>19:18</a> Discipline your child while there is hope,
> but do not set your heart on causing his death.
> <a>19:19</a> A person with great anger bears the penalty,
> but if you deliver him from it, you will have to do it again.
> <a>19:20</a> Listen to advice and receive discipline,
> that you may become wise by the end of your life.
> <a>19:21</a> There are many plans in a person’s mind,
> but it is the counsel of the Lord which will stand.
> <a>19:22</a> What is desirable for a person is to show loyal love,
> and a poor person is better than a liar.
> <a>19:23</a> Fearing the Lord leads to life,
> and one who does so will live satisfied; he will not be afflicted by calamity.
> <a>19:24</a> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish,
> and he will not even bring it back to his mouth!
> <a>19:25</a> Beat a scorner, and as a result the simpleton will learn prudence;
> correct a discerning person, and as a result he will understand knowledge.
> <a>19:26</a> The one who robs his father and drives out his mother
> is a son who brings shame and disgrace.
> <a>19:27</a> If you stop listening to instruction, my child,
> you will stray from the words of knowledge.
> <a>19:28</a> A crooked witness scorns justice,
> and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.
> <a>19:29</a> Judgments are prepared for scorners,
> and floggings for the backs of fools.

## Chapter 20

> <a>20:1</a> Wine is a mocker and strong drink is a brawler;
> whoever goes astray by them is not wise.
> <a>20:2</a> The king’s terrifying anger is like the roar of a lion;
> whoever provokes him sins against himself.
> <a>20:3</a> It is an honor for a person to cease from strife,
> but every fool quarrels.
> <a>20:4</a> The sluggard will not plow during the planting season,
> so at the harvest time he looks for the crop but has nothing.
> <a>20:5</a> Counsel in a person’s heart is like deep water,
> but an understanding person draws it out.
> <a>20:6</a> Many people profess their loyalty,
> but a faithful person—who can find?
> <a>20:7</a> The righteous person behaves in integrity;
> blessed are his children after him.
> <a>20:8</a> A king sitting on the throne to judge
> separates out all evil with his eyes.
> <a>20:9</a> Who can say, “I have kept my heart clean;
> I am pure from my sin”?
> <a>20:10</a> Diverse weights and diverse measures—
> the Lord abhors both of them.
> <a>20:11</a> Even a young man is known by his actions,
> whether his activity is pure and whether it is right.
> <a>20:12</a> The ear that hears and the eye that sees—
> the Lord has made them both.
> <a>20:13</a> Do not love sleep, lest you become impoverished;
> open your eyes so that you might be satisfied with food.
> <a>20:14</a> “It’s worthless! It’s worthless!” says the buyer,
> but when he goes on his way, he boasts.
> <a>20:15</a> There is gold, and an abundance of rubies,
> but words of knowledge are like a precious jewel.
> <a>20:16</a> Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,
> and when he gives surety for strangers, hold him in pledge.
> <a>20:17</a> Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a person,
> but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.
> <a>20:18</a> Plans are established by counsel,
> so make war with guidance.
> <a>20:19</a> The one who goes about gossiping reveals secrets;
> therefore do not associate with one who is always opening his mouth.
> <a>20:20</a> The one who curses his father and his mother,
> his lamp will be put out in the blackest darkness.
> <a>20:21</a> An inheritance gained easily in the beginning
> will not be blessed in its end.
> <a>20:22</a> Do not say, “I will pay back evil!”
> Wait for the Lord, so that he may vindicate you.
> <a>20:23</a> The Lord abhors differing weights,
> and dishonest scales are wicked.
> <a>20:24</a> The steps of a person are ordained by the Lord—
> so how can anyone understand his own way?
> <a>20:25</a> It is a snare for a person to rashly cry, “Holy!”
> and only afterward to consider what he has vowed.
> <a>20:26</a> A wise king separates out the wicked;
> he turns the threshing wheel over them.
> <a>20:27</a> The human spirit is like the lamp of the Lord,
> searching all the innermost parts.
> <a>20:28</a> Loyal love and truth preserve a king,
> and his throne is upheld by loyal love.
> <a>20:29</a> The glory of young men is their strength,
> and the splendor of old men is gray hair.
> <a>20:30</a> Beatings and wounds cleanse away evil,
> and floggings cleanse the innermost being.

## Chapter 21

> <a>21:1</a> The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord like channels of water;
> he turns it wherever he wants.
> <a>21:2</a> All of a person’s ways seem right in his own opinion,
> but the Lord evaluates the motivations.
> <a>21:3</a> To do righteousness and justice
> is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.
> <a>21:4</a> Haughty eyes and a proud heart—
> the agricultural product of the wicked is sin.
> <a>21:5</a> The plans of the diligent lead only to plenty,
> but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.
> <a>21:6</a> Making a fortune by a lying tongue is like a vapor driven back and forth;
> they seek death.
> <a>21:7</a> The violence done by the wicked will drag them away
> because they refuse to do what is right.
> <a>21:8</a> The way of the guilty person is devious,
> but as for the pure, his way is upright.
> <a>21:9</a> It is better to live on a corner of the housetop
> than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.
> <a>21:10</a> The appetite of the wicked desires evil;
> his neighbor is shown no favor in his eyes.
> <a>21:11</a> When a scorner is punished, the naive becomes wise;
> when a wise person is instructed, he gains knowledge.
> <a>21:12</a> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked;
> he overthrows the wicked to their ruin.
> <a>21:13</a> The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor,
> he too will cry out and will not be answered.
> <a>21:14</a> A gift given in secret subdues anger,
> and a bribe given secretly subdues strong wrath.
> <a>21:15</a> Doing justice brings joy to the righteous
> and terror to those who do evil.
> <a>21:16</a> The one who wanders from the way of wisdom
> will rest in the company of the departed.
> <a>21:17</a> The one who loves pleasure will be a poor person;
> whoever loves wine and anointing oil will not be rich.
> <a>21:18</a> The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,
> and the faithless are taken in the place of the upright.
> <a>21:19</a> It is better to live in a desert land
> than with a quarrelsome and easily provoked woman.
> <a>21:20</a> There is desirable treasure and olive oil in the dwelling of the wise,
> but a foolish person devours all he has.
> <a>21:21</a> The one who pursues righteousness and love
> finds life, bounty, and honor.
> <a>21:22</a> The wise person can scale the city of the mighty
> and bring down the stronghold in which they trust.
> <a>21:23</a> The one who guards his mouth and his tongue
> keeps his life from troubles.
> <a>21:24</a> A proud and arrogant person, whose name is “Scoffer,”
> acts with overbearing pride.
> <a>21:25</a> What the sluggard desires will kill him,
> for his hands refuse to work.
> <a>21:26</a> All day long he craves greedily,
> but the righteous gives and does not hold back.
> <a>21:27</a> The wicked person’s sacrifice is an abomination;
> how much more when he brings it with evil intent!
> <a>21:28</a> A lying witness will perish,
> but the one who reports accurately speaks forever.
> <a>21:29</a> A wicked person shows boldness with his face,
> but as for the upright, he discerns his ways.
> <a>21:30</a> There is no wisdom and there is no understanding,
> and there is no counsel against the Lord.
> <a>21:31</a> A horse is prepared for the day of battle,
> but the victory is from the Lord.

## Chapter 22

> <a>22:1</a> A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth,
> good favor more than silver or gold.
> <a>22:2</a> The rich and the poor meet together;
> the Lord is the Creator of them both.
> <a>22:3</a> A shrewd person sees danger and hides himself,
> but the naive keep right on going and suffer for it.
> <a>22:4</a> The reward for humility and fearing the Lord
> is riches and honor and life.
> <a>22:5</a> Thorns and snares are in the path of the perverse,
> but the one who guards himself keeps far from them.
> <a>22:6</a> Train a child in the way that he should go,
> and when he is old he will not turn from it.
> <a>22:7</a> The rich rule over the poor,
> and the borrower is servant to the lender.
> <a>22:8</a> The one who sows iniquity will reap trouble,
> and the rod of his fury will end.
> <a>22:9</a> A generous person will be blessed,
> for he gives some of his food to the poor.
> <a>22:10</a> Drive out the scorner and contention will leave;
> strife and insults will cease.
> <a>22:11</a> The one who loves a pure heart
> and whose speech is gracious—the king will be his friend.
> <a>22:12</a> The eyes of the Lord guard knowledge,
> but he overthrows the words of the faithless person.
> <a>22:13</a> The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!
> I will be killed in the middle of the streets!”
> <a>22:14</a> The mouth of an adulteress is like a deep pit;
> the one against whom the Lord is angry will fall into it.
> <a>22:15</a> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
> but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him.
> <a>22:16</a> The one who oppresses the poor to gain his own increase
> and the one who gives to the rich—both end up only in poverty.

### The Sayings of the Wise

> <a>22:17</a> Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise,
> and apply your heart to my knowledge.
> <a>22:18</a> For it is pleasing if you keep these sayings within you,
> and they are ready on your lips.
> <a>22:19</a> So that your confidence may be in the Lord,
> I make them known to you today—even you.
> <a>22:20</a> Have I not written thirty sayings for you,
> sayings of counsel and knowledge,
> <a>22:21</a> to show you true and reliable words,
> so that you may give accurate answers to those who sent you?
> <a>22:22</a> Do not exploit a poor person because he is poor
> and do not crush the needy in court,
> <a>22:23</a> for the Lord will plead their case
> and will rob those who are robbing them.
> <a>22:24</a> Do not make friends with an angry person,
> and do not associate with a wrathful person,
> <a>22:25</a> lest you learn his ways
> and entangle yourself in a snare.
> <a>22:26</a> Do not be one who strikes hands in pledge
> or who puts up security for debts.
> <a>22:27</a> If you do not have enough to pay,
> your bed will be taken right out from under you!
> <a>22:28</a> Do not move an ancient boundary stone
> which was put in place by your ancestors.
> <a>22:29</a> Do you see a person skilled in his work?
> He will take his position before kings;
> he will not take his position before obscure people.

## Chapter 23

> <a>23:1</a> When you sit down to eat with a ruler,
> consider carefully what is before you,
> <a>23:2</a> and put a knife to your throat
> if you possess a large appetite.
> <a>23:3</a> Do not crave that ruler’s delicacies,
> for that food is deceptive.
> <a>23:4</a> Do not wear yourself out to become rich;
> be wise enough to restrain yourself.
> <a>23:5</a> When you gaze upon riches, they are gone,
> for they surely make wings for themselves,
> and fly off into the sky like an eagle!
> <a>23:6</a> Do not eat the food of a stingy person,
> do not crave his delicacies;
> <a>23:7</a> for he is like someone calculating the cost in his mind.
> “Eat and drink,” he says to you,
> but his heart is not with you;
> <a>23:8</a> you will vomit up the little bit you have eaten,
> and will have wasted your pleasant words.
> <a>23:9</a> Do not speak in the ears of a fool,
> for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
> <a>23:10</a> Do not move an ancient boundary stone,
> or take over the fields of the fatherless,
> <a>23:11</a> for their Protector is strong;
> he will plead their case against you.
> <a>23:12</a> Apply your heart to instruction
> and your ears to the words of knowledge.
> <a>23:13</a> Do not withhold discipline from a child;
> even if you strike him with the rod, he will not die.
> <a>23:14</a> If you strike him with the rod,
> you will deliver his life from death.
> <a>23:15</a> My child, if your heart is wise,
> then my heart also will be glad;
> <a>23:16</a> my soul will rejoice
> when your lips speak what is right.
> <a>23:17</a> Do not let your heart envy sinners,
> but rather be zealous in fearing the Lord all the time.
> <a>23:18</a> For surely there is a future,
> and your hope will not be cut off.
> <a>23:19</a> Listen, my child, and be wise,
> and guide your heart on the right way.
> <a>23:20</a> Do not be among those who drink too much wine,
> among those who eat too much meat,
> <a>23:21</a> because drunkards and gluttons become impoverished,
> and drowsiness clothes them with rags.
> <a>23:22</a> Listen to your father who begot you,
> and do not despise your mother when she is old.
> <a>23:23</a> Acquire truth and do not sell it—
> wisdom, and discipline, and understanding.
> <a>23:24</a> The father of a righteous person will rejoice greatly;
> whoever fathers a wise child will have joy in him.
> <a>23:25</a> May your father and your mother have joy;
> may she who bore you rejoice.
> <a>23:26</a> Give me your heart, my child,
> and let your eyes observe my ways;
> <a>23:27</a> for a prostitute is like a deep pit;
> a harlot is like a narrow well.
> <a>23:28</a> Indeed, she lies in wait like a robber,
> and increases the unfaithful among men.
> <a>23:29</a> Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
> Who has contentions? Who has complaints?
> Who has wounds without cause? Who has dullness of the eyes?
> <a>23:30</a> Those who linger over wine,
> those who go looking for mixed wine.
> <a>23:31</a> Do not look on the wine when it is red,
> when it sparkles in the cup,
> when it goes down smoothly.
> <a>23:32</a> Afterward it bites like a snake,
> and stings like a viper.
> <a>23:33</a> Your eyes will see strange things,
> and your mind will speak perverse things.
> <a>23:34</a> And you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
> and like one who lies down on the top of the rigging.
> <a>23:35</a> You will say, “They have struck me, but I am not harmed!
> They beat me, but I did not know it!
> When will I awake? I will look for another drink.”

## Chapter 24

> <a>24:1</a> Do not envy evil people,
> do not desire to be with them;
> <a>24:2</a> for their hearts contemplate violence,
> and their lips speak harm.
> <a>24:3</a> By wisdom a house is built,
> and through understanding it is established;
> <a>24:4</a> by knowledge its rooms are filled
> with all kinds of precious and pleasing treasures.
> <a>24:5</a> A wise warrior is strong,
> and a man of knowledge makes his strength stronger;
> <a>24:6</a> for with guidance you wage your war,
> and with numerous advisers there is victory.
> <a>24:7</a> Wisdom is unattainable for a fool;
> in court he does not open his mouth.
> <a>24:8</a> The one who plans to do evil
> will be called a scheming person.
> <a>24:9</a> A foolish scheme is sin,
> and the scorner is an abomination to people.
> <a>24:10</a> If you faint in the day of trouble,
> your strength is small!
> <a>24:11</a> Deliver those being taken away to death,
> and hold back those slipping to the slaughter.
> <a>24:12</a> If you say, “But we did not know about this,”
> does not the one who evaluates hearts consider?
> Does not the one who guards your life know?
> Will he not repay each person according to his work?
> <a>24:13</a> Eat honey, my child, for it is good,
> and honey from the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.
> <a>24:14</a> Likewise, know that wisdom is sweet to your soul;
> if you find it, you will have a future,
> and your hope will not be cut off.
> <a>24:15</a> Do not lie in wait like the wicked against the place where the righteous live;
> do not assault his home.
> <a>24:16</a> Although a righteous person may fall seven times, he gets up again,
> but the wicked will be brought down by calamity.
> <a>24:17</a> Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
> and when he stumbles do not let your heart rejoice,
> <a>24:18</a> lest the Lord see, and it displease him,
> and he turn his wrath away from him.
> <a>24:19</a> Do not fret because of evil people
> or be envious of wicked people,
> <a>24:20</a> for the evil person has no future,
> and the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
> <a>24:21</a> Fear the Lord, my child, as well as the king,
> and do not associate with rebels,
> <a>24:22</a> for suddenly their destruction will come,
> and who knows the ruinous judgment both the Lord and the king can bring?

### Further Sayings of the Wise

> <a>24:23</a> These sayings also are from the wise:
> To show partiality in judgment is terrible:
> <a>24:24</a> The one who says to the guilty, “You are innocent,”
> peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him.
> <a>24:25</a> But there will be delight for those who rebuke them,
> and a pleasing blessing will come on them.
> <a>24:26</a> Like a kiss on the lips
> is the one who gives an honest answer.
> <a>24:27</a> Establish your work outside and get your fields ready;
> afterward build your house.
> <a>24:28</a> Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,
> and do not deceive with your words.
> <a>24:29</a> Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me;
> I will deal with him in accordance with what he has done.”
> <a>24:30</a> I passed by the field of a sluggard,
> by the vineyard of one who lacks wisdom.
> <a>24:31</a> I saw that thorns had grown up all over it,
> the ground was covered with weeds,
> and its stone wall was broken down.
> <a>24:32</a> When I saw this, I applied my heart;
> I received instruction from what I saw:
> <a>24:33</a> “A little sleep, a little slumber,
> a little folding of the hands to relax,
> <a>24:34</a> and your poverty will come like a robber,
> and your need like an armed man.”

### Proverbs of Solomon Collected by Hezekiah

> <a>25:1</a> These also are proverbs of Solomon,
> which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied:
> <a>25:2</a> It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
> and it is the glory of a king to search out a matter.
> <a>25:3</a> As the heaven is high and the earth deep
> so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
> <a>25:4</a> Remove the dross from the silver,
> and material for the silversmith will emerge;
> <a>25:5</a> remove the wicked from before the king,
> and his throne will be established in righteousness.
> <a>25:6</a> Do not honor yourself before the king,
> and do not stand in the place of great men;
> <a>25:7</a> for it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”
> than to put you lower before a prince,
> whom your eyes have seen.
> <a>25:8</a> Do not go out hastily to litigation,
> or what will you do after it
> when your neighbor puts you to shame?
> <a>25:9</a> When you argue a case with your neighbor,
> do not reveal the secret of another person,
> <a>25:10</a> lest the one who hears it put you to shame
> and your infamy will never go away.
> <a>25:11</a> Like apples of gold in settings of silver,
> so is a word skillfully spoken.
> <a>25:12</a> Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold,
> so is a wise reprover to the ear of the one who listens.
> <a>25:13</a> Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
> so is a faithful messenger to those who send him,
> for he refreshes the heart of his masters.
> <a>25:14</a> Like clouded skies and wind without rain,
> so is the one who boasts of a gift not given.
> <a>25:15</a> Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,
> and a soft tongue can break a bone.
> <a>25:16</a> When you find honey, eat what is sufficient for you,
> lest you should become filled with it and vomit it up.
> <a>25:17</a> Make your foot rare in your neighbor’s house,
> lest he become weary of you and hate you.
> <a>25:18</a> Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow,
> so is the one who testifies against his neighbor as a false witness.
> <a>25:19</a> Like a bad tooth or a foot out of joint,
> so is confidence in an unfaithful person at the time of trouble.
> <a>25:20</a> Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,
> or like vinegar poured in soda,
> so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
> <a>25:21</a> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,
> and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,
> <a>25:22</a> for you will heap coals of fire on his head,
> and the Lord will reward you.
> <a>25:23</a> The north wind brings forth rain,
> and a sly tongue brings forth an angry look.
> <a>25:24</a> It is better to live on a corner of the housetop
> than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.
> <a>25:25</a> Like cold water to a weary person,
> so is good news from a distant land.
> <a>25:26</a> Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,
> so is a righteous person who gives way before the wicked.
> <a>25:27</a> It is not good to eat too much honey,
> nor is it honorable for people to seek their own glory.
> <a>25:28</a> Like a city that is broken down and without a wall,
> so is a person who cannot control his temper.

## Chapter 26

> <a>26:1</a> Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
> so honor is not fitting for a fool.
> <a>26:2</a> Like a fluttering bird or like a flying swallow,
> so a causeless curse does not come to rest.
> <a>26:3</a> A whip for the horse and a bridle for the donkey,
> and a rod for the backs of fools!
> <a>26:4</a> Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
> lest you yourself also be like him.
> <a>26:5</a> Answer a fool according to his folly,
> lest he be wise in his own estimation.
> <a>26:6</a> Like cutting off the feet or drinking violence,
> so is sending a message in the hand of a fool.
> <a>26:7</a> Like legs that hang limp from the lame,
> so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
> <a>26:8</a> Like tying a stone in a sling,
> so is giving honor to a fool.
> <a>26:9</a> Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard,
> so is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
> <a>26:10</a> Like an archer who wounds at random,
> so is the one who hires a fool or hires any passer-by.
> <a>26:11</a> Like a dog that returns to its vomit,
> so a fool repeats his folly.
> <a>26:12</a> Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?
> There is more hope for a fool than for him.
> <a>26:13</a> The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
> A lion in the streets!”
> <a>26:14</a> Like a door that turns on its hinges,
> so a sluggard turns on his bed.
> <a>26:15</a> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
> he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
> <a>26:16</a> The sluggard is wiser in his own estimation
> than seven people who respond with good sense.
> <a>26:17</a> Like one who grabs a wild dog by the ears,
> so is the person passing by who becomes furious over a quarrel not his own.
> <a>26:18</a> Like a madman who shoots
> firebrands and deadly arrows,
> <a>26:19</a> so is a person who deceives his neighbor,
> and says, “Was I not only joking?”
> <a>26:20</a> Where there is no wood, a fire goes out,
> and where there is no gossip, contention dies down.
> <a>26:21</a> Like charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,
> so is a contentious person to kindle strife.
> <a>26:22</a> The words of a gossip are like delicious morsels;
> they go down into a person’s innermost being.
> <a>26:23</a> Like a coating of glaze over earthenware
> are fervent lips with an evil heart.
> <a>26:24</a> The one who hates others disguises it with his lips,
> but he keeps deceit within him.
> <a>26:25</a> When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,
> for there are seven abominations within him.
> <a>26:26</a> Though his hatred may be concealed by deceit,
> his evil will be uncovered in the assembly.
> <a>26:27</a> The one who digs a pit will fall into it;
> the one who rolls a stone—it will come back on him.
> <a>26:28</a> A lying tongue hates those crushed by it,
> and a flattering mouth works ruin.

## Chapter 27

> <a>27:1</a> Do not boast about tomorrow;
> for you do not know what a day may bring forth.
> <a>27:2</a> Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
> someone else, and not your own lips.
> <a>27:3</a> A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,
> but vexation by a fool more burdensome than the two of them.
> <a>27:4</a> Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,
> but who can stand before jealousy?
> <a>27:5</a> Better is open rebuke
> than hidden love.
> <a>27:6</a> Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
> but the kisses of an enemy are excessive.
> <a>27:7</a> The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey,
> but to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet.
> <a>27:8</a> Like a bird that wanders from its nest,
> so is a person who wanders from his place.
> <a>27:9</a> Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice,
> likewise the sweetness of one’s friend from sincere counsel.
> <a>27:10</a> Do not forsake your friend and the friend of your father,
> and do not enter the house of your brother in the day of your disaster;
> a neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.
> <a>27:11</a> Be wise, my child, and make my heart glad,
> so that I may answer anyone who taunts me.
> <a>27:12</a> A shrewd person sees danger and hides himself,
> but the naive keep right on going and suffer for it.
> <a>27:13</a> Take his garment that is security for a stranger
> and hold him in pledge that is surety for strangers.
> <a>27:14</a> If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
> it will be counted as a curse to him.
> <a>27:15</a> A continual dripping on a rainy day
> and a contentious wife are alike.
> <a>27:16</a> Whoever hides her hides the wind
> or grasps oil with his right hand.
> <a>27:17</a> As iron sharpens iron,
> so one person sharpens his friend.
> <a>27:18</a> The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
> and whoever takes care of his master will be honored.
> <a>27:19</a> As in water the face is reflected as a face,
> so a person’s heart reflects the person.
> <a>27:20</a> As Death and Destruction are never satisfied,
> so the eyes of a person are never satisfied.
> <a>27:21</a> As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,
> so a person is proved by the praise he receives.
> <a>27:22</a> If you should pound the fool in the mortar
> among the grain with the pestle,
> his foolishness would not depart from him.
> <a>27:23</a> Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks,
> give careful attention to your herds,
> <a>27:24</a> for riches do not last forever,
> nor does a crown last from generation to generation.
> <a>27:25</a> When the hay is removed and new grass appears,
> and the grass from the hills is gathered in,
> <a>27:26</a> the lambs will be for your clothing,
> and the goats will be for the price of a field.
> <a>27:27</a> And there will be enough goat’s milk for your food,
> for the food of your household,
> and for the maintenance of your servant girls.

## Chapter 28

> <a>28:1</a> The wicked person flees when there is no one pursuing,
> but the righteous person is as confident as a lion.
> <a>28:2</a> When a country is rebellious it has many princes,
> but by someone who is discerning and knowledgeable order continues.
> <a>28:3</a> A poor person who oppresses the weak
> is like a driving rain without food.
> <a>28:4</a> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
> but those who keep the law contend with them.
> <a>28:5</a> Evil people do not understand justice,
> but those who seek the Lord understand it all.
> <a>28:6</a> A poor person who walks in his integrity is better
> than one who is perverse in his ways even though he is rich.
> <a>28:7</a> The one who keeps the law is a discerning child,
> but a companion of gluttons brings shame to his father.
> <a>28:8</a> The one who increases his wealth by increasing interest
> gathers it for someone who is gracious to the needy.
> <a>28:9</a> The one who turns away his ear from hearing the law,
> even his prayer is an abomination.
> <a>28:10</a> The one who leads the upright astray in an evil way
> will himself fall into his own pit,
> but the blameless will inherit what is good.
> <a>28:11</a> A rich person is wise in his own eyes,
> but a discerning poor person can evaluate him properly.
> <a>28:12</a> When the righteous rejoice, great is the glory,
> but when the wicked rise to power, people are sought out.
> <a>28:13</a> The one who covers his transgressions will not prosper,
> but whoever confesses and abandons them will find mercy.
> <a>28:14</a> Blessed is the one who is always cautious,
> but whoever hardens his heart will fall into evil.
> <a>28:15</a> Like a roaring lion or a roving bear,
> so is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
> <a>28:16</a> The prince who is a great oppressor lacks wisdom,
> but the one who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.
> <a>28:17</a> The one who is tormented by the murder of another will flee to the pit;
> let no one support him.
> <a>28:18</a> The one who walks blamelessly will be delivered,
> but whoever is perverse in his ways will fall at once.
> <a>28:19</a> The one who works his land will be satisfied with food,
> but whoever chases daydreams will have his fill of poverty.
> <a>28:20</a> A faithful person will have an abundance of blessings,
> but the one who hastens to gain riches will not go unpunished.
> <a>28:21</a> To show partiality is terrible,
> for a man will transgress over the smallest piece of bread.
> <a>28:22</a> The stingy person hastens after riches
> and does not know that poverty will come on him.
> <a>28:23</a> The one who reproves another will in the end find more favor
> than the one who flatters with the tongue.
> <a>28:24</a> The one who robs his father and mother and says, “There is no transgression,”
> the same is a companion to the one who destroys.
> <a>28:25</a> The greedy person stirs up dissension,
> but the one who trusts in the Lord will prosper.
> <a>28:26</a> The one who trusts in his own heart is a fool,
> but the one who walks in wisdom will escape.
> <a>28:27</a> The one who gives to the poor will not lack,
> but whoever hides his eyes will receive many curses.
> <a>28:28</a> When the wicked rise, people hide themselves,
> but when they perish, the righteous increase.

## Chapter 29

> <a>29:1</a> The one who hardens his neck after numerous rebukes
> will suddenly be destroyed without remedy.
> <a>29:2</a> When the righteous become numerous, the people rejoice;
> when the wicked rule, the people groan.
> <a>29:3</a> The one who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,
> but whoever associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth.
> <a>29:4</a> A king brings stability to a land by justice,
> but one who exacts tribute tears it down.
> <a>29:5</a> The one who flatters his neighbor
> spreads a net for his steps.
> <a>29:6</a> In the transgression of an evil person there is a snare,
> but a righteous person can sing and rejoice.
> <a>29:7</a> The righteous person cares for the legal rights of the poor;
> the wicked does not understand such knowledge.
> <a>29:8</a> Scornful people inflame a city,
> but those who are wise turn away wrath.
> <a>29:9</a> If a wise person goes to court with a foolish person,
> there is no rest whether he is angry or laughs.
> <a>29:10</a> Bloodthirsty people hate someone with integrity;
> as for the upright, they seek his life.
> <a>29:11</a> A fool lets out all his temper,
> but a wise person keeps it back.
> <a>29:12</a> If a ruler listens to lies,
> all his ministers will be wicked.
> <a>29:13</a> The poor person and the oppressor have this in common:
> the Lord gives light to the eyes of them both.
> <a>29:14</a> If a king judges the poor in truth,
> his throne will be established forever.
> <a>29:15</a> A rod and reproof imparts wisdom,
> but a child who is unrestrained brings shame to his mother.
> <a>29:16</a> When the wicked increase, transgression increases,
> but the righteous will see their downfall.
> <a>29:17</a> Discipline your child, and he will give you rest;
> he will give pleasure to you.
> <a>29:18</a> When there is no vision the people cast off restraint,
> but the one who keeps the law, blessed is he!
> <a>29:19</a> A servant cannot be corrected by words,
> for although he understands, there is no answer.
> <a>29:20</a> Do you see someone who is hasty in his words?
> There is more hope for a fool than for him.
> <a>29:21</a> If someone pampers his servant from youth,
> he will be a weakling in the end.
> <a>29:22</a> An angry person stirs up dissension,
> and a wrathful one is abounding in transgression.
> <a>29:23</a> A person’s pride will bring him low,
> but one who has a lowly spirit will gain honor.
> <a>29:24</a> Whoever shares with a thief is his own enemy;
> he hears the adjuration, but does not talk.
> <a>29:25</a> The fear of people becomes a snare,
> but whoever trusts in the Lord will be set on high.
> <a>29:26</a> Many people seek the face of a ruler,
> but it is from the Lord that one receives justice.
> <a>29:27</a> An unjust person is an abomination to the righteous,
> and the one who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.

## Chapter 30

### The Words of Agur

> <a>30:1</a> The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle;
> This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal:
> <a>30:2</a> Surely I am more brutish than any other man,
> and I do not have human understanding;
> <a>30:3</a> I have not learned wisdom,
> nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One.
> <a>30:4</a> Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended?
> Who has gathered up the winds in his fists?
> Who has bound up the waters in his cloak?
> Who has established all the ends of the earth?
> What is his name, and what is the name of his son? —if you know!
> <a>30:5</a> Every word of God is purified;
> he is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.
> <a>30:6</a> Do not add to his words,
> lest he reprove you, and prove you a liar.
> <a>30:7</a> Two things I ask from you;
> do not refuse me before I die:
> <a>30:8</a> Remove falsehood and lies far from me;
> do not give me poverty or riches,
> feed me with my allotted bread,
> <a>30:9</a> lest I become satisfied and act deceptively
> and say, “Who is the Lord?”
> or lest I become poor and steal
> and harm the name of my God.
> <a>30:10</a> Do not slander a servant to his master,
> lest he curse you, and you are found guilty.
> <a>30:11</a> There is a generation who curse their fathers
> and do not bless their mothers;
> <a>30:12</a> there is a generation who are pure in their own eyes
> and yet are not washed from their filthiness;
> <a>30:13</a> there is a generation whose eyes are so lofty,
> and whose eyelids are lifted up;
> <a>30:14</a> there is a generation whose teeth are like swords
> and whose great teeth are like swords
> to devour the poor from the earth
> and the needy from among the human race.
> <a>30:15</a> The leech has two daughters:
> “Give! Give!”
> There are three things that are never satisfied,
> four that never say, “Enough”—
> <a>30:16</a> the grave, the barren womb,
> land that is not satisfied with water,
> and fire that never says, “Enough!”
> <a>30:17</a> The eye that mocks at a father
> and despises obeying a mother—
> the ravens of the valley will peck it out
> and the young vultures will eat it.
> <a>30:18</a> There are three things that are too wonderful for me,
> four that I do not understand:
> <a>30:19</a> the way of an eagle in the sky,
> the way of a snake on a rock,
> the way of a ship in the sea,
> and the way of a man with a woman.
> <a>30:20</a> This is the way of an adulterous woman:
> she eats and wipes her mouth
> and says, “I have not done wrong.”
> <a>30:21</a> Under three things the earth trembles,
> and under four things it cannot bear up:
> <a>30:22</a> under a servant who becomes king,
> under a fool who is filled with food,
> <a>30:23</a> under an unloved woman who is married,
> and under a female servant who dispossesses her mistress.
> <a>30:24</a> There are four things on earth that are small,
> but they are exceedingly wise:
> <a>30:25</a> ants are creatures with little strength,
> but they prepare their food in the summer;
> <a>30:26</a> rock badgers are creatures with little power,
> but they make their homes in the crags;
> <a>30:27</a> locusts have no king,
> but they all go forth by ranks;
> <a>30:28</a> a lizard you can seize with the hand,
> but it is in the palaces of the king.
> <a>30:29</a> There are three things that are magnificent in their step,
> four things that move about magnificently:
> <a>30:30</a> a lion, mightiest of the beasts,
> who does not retreat from anything;
> <a>30:31</a> a strutting rooster, a male goat,
> and a king with his army around him.
> <a>30:32</a> If you have done foolishly in exalting yourself
> or if you have planned evil,
> put your hand over your mouth!
> <a>30:33</a> For as the churning of milk produces butter
> and as punching the nose produces blood,
> so stirring up anger produces strife.

> <a>31:1</a> The words of King Lemuel,
> an oracle that his mother taught him:
> <a>31:2</a> O my son, O son of my womb,
> O son of my vows,
> <a>31:3</a> Do not give your strength to women,
> nor your ways to that which ruins kings.
> <a>31:4</a> It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
> it is not for kings to drink wine,
> or for rulers to crave strong drink,
> <a>31:5</a> lest they drink and forget what is decreed,
> and remove from all the poor their rights.
> <a>31:6</a> Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
> and wine to those who are distressed;
> <a>31:7</a> let them drink and forget their poverty,
> and remember their misery no more.
> <a>31:8</a> Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak,
> for the legal rights of all the dying.
> <a>31:9</a> Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,
> and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
> The Wife of Noble Character
> <a>31:10</a> Who can find a wife of noble character?
> For her value is far more than rubies.
> <a>31:11</a> The heart of her husband has confidence in her,
> and he has no lack of gain.
> <a>31:12</a> She brings him good and not evil
> all the days of her life.
> <a>31:13</a> She obtains wool and flax,
> and she is pleased to work with her hands.
> <a>31:14</a> She is like the merchant ships;
> she brings her food from afar.
> <a>31:15</a> She also gets up while it is still night,
> and provides food for her household and a portion to her female servants.
> <a>31:16</a> She considers a field and buys it;
> from her own income she plants a vineyard.
> <a>31:17</a> She begins her work vigorously,
> and she strengthens her arms.
> <a>31:18</a> She knows that her merchandise is good,
> and her lamp does not go out in the night.
> <a>31:19</a> Her hands take hold of the distaff,
> and her hands grasp the spindle.
> <a>31:20</a> She extends her hand to the poor,
> and reaches out her hand to the needy.
> <a>31:21</a> She is not afraid of the snow for her household,
> for all of her household are clothed with scarlet.
> <a>31:22</a> She makes for herself coverlets;
> her clothing is fine linen and purple.
> <a>31:23</a> Her husband is well-known in the city gate
> when he sits with the elders of the land.
> <a>31:24</a> She makes linen garments and sells them,
> and supplies the merchants with sashes.
> <a>31:25</a> She is clothed with strength and honor,
> and she can laugh at the time to come.
> <a>31:26</a> She opens her mouth with wisdom,
> and loving instruction is on her tongue.
> <a>31:27</a> She watches over the ways of her household,
> and does not eat the bread of idleness.
> <a>31:28</a> Her children rise up and call her blessed,
> her husband also praises her:
> <a>31:29</a> “Many daughters have done valiantly,
> but you surpass them all.”
> <a>31:30</a> Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting,
> but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.
> <a>31:31</a> Give her credit for what she has accomplished,
> and let her works praise her in the city gates.
