## Chapter 1

### Introduction to the Book

> <cite>1:1</cite> The Proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
> <cite>1:2</cite> To learn wisdom and moral instruction,
> and to discern wise counsel.
> <cite>1:3</cite> To receive moral instruction in skillful living,
> in righteousness, justice, and equity.
> <cite>1:4</cite> To impart shrewdness to the morally naive,
> and a discerning plan to the young person.
> <cite>1:5</cite> (Let the wise also hear and gain instruction,
> and let the discerning acquire guidance!)
> <cite>1:6</cite> To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable,
> the sayings of the wise and their riddles.

### Introduction to the Theme of the Book

> <cite>1:7</cite> Fearing the Lord is the beginning of moral knowledge,
> but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
> <cite>1:8</cite> Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father,
> and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.
> <cite>1:9</cite> For they will be like an elegant garland on your head,
> and like pendants around your neck.

### Admonition to Avoid Easy but Unjust Riches

> <cite>1:10</cite> My child, if sinners try to entice you,
> do not consent!
> <cite>1:11</cite> If they say, “Come with us!
> We will lie in wait to shed blood;
> we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.
> <cite>1:12</cite> We will swallow them alive like Sheol,
> those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.
> <cite>1:13</cite> We will seize all kinds of precious wealth;
> we will fill our houses with plunder.
> <cite>1:14</cite> Join with us!
> We will all share equally in what we steal.”
> <cite>1:15</cite> My child, do not go down their way,
> withhold yourself from their path;
> <cite>1:16</cite> for they are eager to inflict harm,
> and they hasten to shed blood.
> <cite>1:17</cite> Surely it is futile to spread a net
> in view of any bird,
> <cite>1:18</cite> but these men lie in wait for their own blood,
> they ambush their own lives!
> <cite>1:19</cite> Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly;
> it takes away the life of those who obtain it.

### Warning Against Disregarding Wisdom

> <cite>1:20</cite> Wisdom calls out in the street,
> she shouts loudly in the plazas;
> <cite>1:21</cite> at the head of the noisy streets she calls,
> in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:
> <cite>1:22</cite> “How long will you simpletons love naiveté?
> How long will mockers delight in mockery
> and fools hate knowledge?
> <cite>1:23</cite> If only you will respond to my rebuke,
> then I will pour out my thoughts to you
> and I will make my words known to you.
> <cite>1:24</cite> However, because I called but you refused to listen,
> because I stretched out my hand but no one paid attention,
> <cite>1:25</cite> because you neglected all my advice,
> and did not comply with my rebuke,
> <cite>1:26</cite> so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you,
> I will mock when what you dread comes,
> <cite>1:27</cite> when what you dread comes like a whirlwind,
> and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm,
> when distressing trouble comes on you.
> <cite>1:28</cite> Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;
> they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.
> <cite>1:29</cite> Because they hated moral knowledge,
> and did not choose to fear the Lord,
> <cite>1:30</cite> they did not comply with my advice,
> they spurned all my rebuke.
> <cite>1:31</cite> Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way,
> and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.
> <cite>1:32</cite> For the waywardness of the simpletons will kill them,
> and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.
> <cite>1:33</cite> But the one who listens to me will live in security,
> and will be at ease from the dread of harm.

## Chapter 2

### Benefits of Seeking Wisdom

> <cite>2:1</cite> My child, if you receive my words,
> and store up my commands within you,
> <cite>2:2</cite> by making your ear attentive to wisdom,
> and by turning your heart to understanding,
> <cite>2:3</cite> indeed, if you call out for understanding,
> and raise your voice for understanding,
> <cite>2:4</cite> if you seek it like silver,
> and search for it like hidden treasure,
> <cite>2:5</cite> then you will understand how to fear the Lord,
> and you will discover knowledge about God.
> <cite>2:6</cite> For the Lord gives wisdom,
> and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
> <cite>2:7</cite> He stores up effective counsel for the upright,
> and is like a shield for those who live with integrity,
> <cite>2:8</cite> to guard the paths of the righteous
> and to protect the way of his pious ones.
> <cite>2:9</cite> Then you will understand righteousness and justice
> and equity—every good way.
> <cite>2:10</cite> For wisdom will enter your heart,
> and moral knowledge will be attractive to you.
> <cite>2:11</cite> Discretion will protect you,
> understanding will guard you,
> <cite>2:12</cite> to deliver you from the way of the wicked,
> from those speaking perversity,
> <cite>2:13</cite> who leave the upright paths
> to walk on the dark ways,
> <cite>2:14</cite> who delight in doing evil,
> they rejoice in perverse evil;
> <cite>2:15</cite> whose paths are morally crooked,
> and who are devious in their ways;
> <cite>2:16</cite> to deliver you from the adulteress,
> from the sexually loose woman who speaks flattering words;
> <cite>2:17</cite> who leaves the husband from her youth,
> and forgets her marriage covenant made before God.
> <cite>2:18</cite> For her house sinks down to death,
> and her paths lead to the place of the departed spirits.
> <cite>2:19</cite> None who go in to her will return,
> nor will they reach the paths of life.
> <cite>2:20</cite> So you will walk in the way of good people,
> and will keep on the paths of the righteous.
> <cite>2:21</cite> For the upright will reside in the land,
> and those with integrity will remain in it,
> <cite>2:22</cite> but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
> and the treacherous will be torn away from it.

## Chapter 3

### Exhortations to Seek Wisdom and Walk with the Lord

> <cite>3:1</cite> My child, do not forget my teaching,
> but let your heart keep my commandments,
> <cite>3:2</cite> for they will provide a long and full life,
> and they will add well-being to you.
> <cite>3:3</cite> Do not let truth and mercy leave you;
> bind them around your neck,
> write them on the tablet of your heart.
> <cite>3:4</cite> Then you will find favor and good understanding,
> in the sight of God and people.
> <cite>3:5</cite> Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
> and do not rely on your own understanding.
> <cite>3:6</cite> Acknowledge him in all your ways,
> and he will make your paths straight.
> <cite>3:7</cite> Do not be wise in your own estimation;
> fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
> <cite>3:8</cite> This will bring healing to your body,
> and refreshment to your inner self.
> <cite>3:9</cite> Honor the Lord from your wealth
> and from the first fruits of all your crops;
> <cite>3:10</cite> then your barns will be filled completely,
> and your vats will overflow with new wine.
> <cite>3:11</cite> My child, do not despise discipline from the Lord,
> and do not loathe his rebuke.
> <cite>3:12</cite> For the Lord disciplines those he loves,
> just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.

### Blessings of Obtaining Wisdom

> <cite>3:13</cite> Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,
> and the one who obtains understanding.
> <cite>3:14</cite> For her benefit is more profitable than silver,
> and her gain is better than gold.
> <cite>3:15</cite> She is more precious than rubies,
> and none of the things you desire can compare with her.
> <cite>3:16</cite> Long life is in her right hand;
> in her left hand are riches and honor.
> <cite>3:17</cite> Her ways are very pleasant,
> and all her paths are peaceful.
> <cite>3:18</cite> She is like a tree of life to those who obtain her,
> and everyone who grasps hold of her will be blessed.
> <cite>3:19</cite> The Lord by wisdom laid the foundation of the earth;
> he established the heavens by understanding.
> <cite>3:20</cite> By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open,
> and the clouds drip down dew.
> <cite>3:21</cite> My child, do not let them escape from your sight;
> safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.
> <cite>3:22</cite> So they will give life to you,
> and grace to adorn your neck.
> <cite>3:23</cite> Then you will walk on your way with security,
> and you will not stumble.
> <cite>3:24</cite> When you lie down you will not be filled with fear,
> and when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.
> <cite>3:25</cite> You will not be afraid of sudden disaster,
> or when destruction comes on the wicked;
> <cite>3:26</cite> for the Lord will be the source of your confidence,
> and he will guard your foot from being ensnared.

### Wisdom Demonstrated in Relationships with People

> <cite>3:27</cite> Do not withhold good from those who need it,
> when you have the ability to do it.
> <cite>3:28</cite> Do not say to your neighbor, “Go! Return tomorrow
> and I will give it”—when you have it with you at the time.
> <cite>3:29</cite> Do not plot evil against your neighbor
> when he dwells by you unsuspectingly.
> <cite>3:30</cite> Do not accuse anyone without legitimate cause,
> if he has not treated you wrongly.
> <cite>3:31</cite> Do not envy a violent man,
> and do not choose any of his ways;
> <cite>3:32</cite> for one who goes astray is an abomination to the Lord,
> but he reveals his intimate counsel to the upright.
> <cite>3:33</cite> The Lord’s curse is on the household of the wicked,
> but he blesses the home of the righteous.
> <cite>3:34</cite> Although he is scornful to arrogant scoffers,
> yet he shows favor to the humble.
> <cite>3:35</cite> The wise inherit honor,
> but he holds fools up to public contempt.

## Chapter 4

### Admonition to Follow Righteousness and Avoid Wickedness

> <cite>4:1</cite> Listen, children, to a father’s instruction,
> and pay attention so that you may gain discernment.
> <cite>4:2</cite> Because I give you good instruction,
> do not forsake my teaching.
> <cite>4:3</cite> When I was a son to my father,
> a tender only child before my mother,
> <cite>4:4</cite> he taught me, and he said to me:
> “Let your heart lay hold of my words;
> keep my commands so that you will live.
> <cite>4:5</cite> Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding;
> do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.
> <cite>4:6</cite> Do not forsake her, and she will protect you;
> love her, and she will guard you.
> <cite>4:7</cite> Wisdom is supreme—so acquire wisdom,
> and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding!
> <cite>4:8</cite> Esteem her highly and she will exalt you;
> she will honor you if you embrace her.
> <cite>4:9</cite> She will place a fair garland on your head;
> she will bestow a beautiful crown on you.”
> <cite>4:10</cite> Listen, my child, and accept my words,
> so that the years of your life will be many.
> <cite>4:11</cite> I will guide you in the way of wisdom
> and I will lead you in upright paths.
> <cite>4:12</cite> When you walk, your steps will not be hampered,
> and when you run, you will not stumble.
> <cite>4:13</cite> Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;
> protect it, because it is your life.
> <cite>4:14</cite> Do not enter the path of the wicked
> or walk in the way of those who are evil.
> <cite>4:15</cite> Avoid it, do not go on it;
> turn away from it, and go on.
> <cite>4:16</cite> For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm;
> they are robbed of sleep until they make someone fall.
> <cite>4:17</cite> For they eat bread gained from wickedness
> and drink wine obtained from violence.
> <cite>4:18</cite> But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light,
> growing brighter and brighter until full day.
> <cite>4:19</cite> The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness;
> they do not know what causes them to stumble.
> <cite>4:20</cite> My child, pay attention to my words;
> listen attentively to my sayings.
> <cite>4:21</cite> Do not let them depart from your sight,
> guard them within your heart;
> <cite>4:22</cite> for they are life to those who find them
> and healing to one’s entire body.
> <cite>4:23</cite> Guard your heart with all vigilance,
> for from it are the sources of life.
> <cite>4:24</cite> Remove perverse speech from your mouth;
> keep devious talk far from your lips.
> <cite>4:25</cite> Let your eyes look directly in front of you
> and let your gaze look straight before you.
> <cite>4:26</cite> Make the path for your feet level,
> so that all your ways may be established.
> <cite>4:27</cite> Do not turn to the right or to the left;
> turn yourself away from evil.

## Chapter 5

### Admonition to Avoid Seduction to Evil

> <cite>5:1</cite> My child, be attentive to my wisdom,
> pay close attention to my understanding,
> <cite>5:2</cite> in order to safeguard discretion,
> and that your lips may guard knowledge.
> <cite>5:3</cite> For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,
> and her seductive words are smoother than oil,
> <cite>5:4</cite> but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
> sharp as a two-edged sword.
> <cite>5:5</cite> Her feet go down to death;
> her steps lead straight to the grave.
> <cite>5:6</cite> Lest she should make level the path leading to life,
> her paths are unstable but she does not know it.
> <cite>5:7</cite> So now, children, listen to me;
> do not turn aside from the words I speak.
> <cite>5:8</cite> Keep yourself far from her,
> and do not go near the door of her house,
> <cite>5:9</cite> lest you give your vigor to others
> and your years to a cruel person,
> <cite>5:10</cite> lest strangers devour your strength,
> and your labor benefit another man’s house.
> <cite>5:11</cite> And at the end of your life you will groan
> when your flesh and your body are wasted away.
> <cite>5:12</cite> And you will say, “How I hated discipline!
> My heart spurned reproof!
> <cite>5:13</cite> For I did not obey my teachers
> and I did not heed my instructors.
> <cite>5:14</cite> I almost came to complete ruin
> in the midst of the whole congregation!”
> <cite>5:15</cite> Drink water from your own cistern
> and running water from your own well.
> <cite>5:16</cite> Should your springs be dispersed outside,
> your streams of water in the wide plazas?
> <cite>5:17</cite> Let them be for yourself alone,
> and not for strangers with you.
> <cite>5:18</cite> May your fountain be blessed,
> and may you rejoice in your young wife—
> <cite>5:19</cite> a loving doe, a graceful deer;
> may her breasts satisfy you at all times,
> may you be captivated by her love always.
> <cite>5:20</cite> But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,
> and embrace the bosom of a different woman?
> <cite>5:21</cite> For the ways of a person are in front of the eyes of the Lord,
> and the Lord weighs all that person’s paths.
> <cite>5:22</cite> The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities,
> and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.
> <cite>5:23</cite> He will die because there was no discipline;
> because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.

## Chapter 6

### Admonitions and Warnings against Dangerous and Destructive Acts

> <cite>6:1</cite> My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor,
> and have become a guarantor for a stranger,
> <cite>6:2</cite> if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered,
> and have been caught by the words you have spoken,
> <cite>6:3</cite> then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself,
> because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:
> go, humble yourself,
> and appeal firmly to your neighbor.
> <cite>6:4</cite> Do not give sleep to your eyes
> or slumber to your eyelids.
> <cite>6:5</cite> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare,
> and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.
> <cite>6:6</cite> Go to the ant, you sluggard;
> observe its ways and be wise!
> <cite>6:7</cite> It has no commander,
> overseer, or ruler,
> <cite>6:8</cite> yet it prepares its food in the summer;
> it gathers at the harvest what it will eat.
> <cite>6:9</cite> How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?
> When will you rise from your sleep?
> <cite>6:10</cite> A little sleep, a little slumber,
> a little folding of the hands to relax,
> <cite>6:11</cite> and your poverty will come like a robber,
> and your need like an armed man.
> <cite>6:12</cite> A worthless and wicked person
> walks around saying perverse things;
> <cite>6:13</cite> he winks with his eyes,
> signals with his feet,
> and points with his fingers;
> <cite>6:14</cite> he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart,
> he spreads contention at all times.
> <cite>6:15</cite> Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;
> in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.
> <cite>6:16</cite> There are six things that the Lord hates,
> even seven things that are an abomination to him:
> <cite>6:17</cite> haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
> and hands that shed innocent blood,
> <cite>6:18</cite> a heart that devises wicked plans,
> feet that are swift to run to evil,
> <cite>6:19</cite> a false witness who pours out lies,
> and a person who spreads discord among family members.
> <cite>6:20</cite> My child, guard the commands of your father
> and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
> <cite>6:21</cite> Bind them on your heart continually;
> fasten them around your neck.
> <cite>6:22</cite> When you walk about, they will guide you;
> when you lie down, they will watch over you;
> when you wake up, they will talk to you.
> <cite>6:23</cite> For the commandments are like a lamp,
> instruction is like a light,
> and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,
> <cite>6:24</cite> by keeping you from the evil woman,
> from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.
> <cite>6:25</cite> Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,
> and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
> <cite>6:26</cite> for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,
> but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.
> <cite>6:27</cite> Can a man hold fire against his chest
> without burning his clothes?
> <cite>6:28</cite> Can a man walk on hot coals
> without scorching his feet?
> <cite>6:29</cite> So it is with the one who has sex with his neighbor’s wife;
> no one who touches her will escape punishment.
> <cite>6:30</cite> People do not despise a thief when he steals
> to fulfill his need when he is hungry.
> <cite>6:31</cite> Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over,
> he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.
> <cite>6:32</cite> A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks wisdom,
> whoever does it destroys his own life.
> <cite>6:33</cite> He will be beaten and despised,
> and his reproach will not be wiped away;
> <cite>6:34</cite> for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,
> and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.
> <cite>6:35</cite> He will not consider any compensation;
> he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.

## Chapter 7

### Admonition to Avoid the Wiles of the Adulteress

> <cite>7:1</cite> My child, keep my words
> and treasure up my commands within your own keeping.
> <cite>7:2</cite> Keep my commands so that you may live,
> and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.
> <cite>7:3</cite> Bind them on your forearm;
> write them on the tablet of your heart.
> <cite>7:4</cite> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
> and call understanding a close relative,
> <cite>7:5</cite> so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman,
> from the loose woman who flatters you with her words.
> <cite>7:6</cite> For at the window of my house
> through my window-lattice I looked out
> <cite>7:7</cite> and I saw among the naive,
> I discerned among the youths,
> a young man who lacked wisdom.
> <cite>7:8</cite> He was passing by the street near her corner,
> making his way along the road to her house
> <cite>7:9</cite> in the twilight, the evening,
> in the dark of the night.
> <cite>7:10</cite> All of a sudden a woman came out to meet him!
> She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.
> <cite>7:11</cite> (She is loud and rebellious,
> she does not remain at home—
> <cite>7:12</cite> at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas,
> and by every corner she lies in wait.)
> <cite>7:13</cite> So she grabbed him and kissed him,
> and with a bold expression she said to him,
> <cite>7:14</cite> “I have fresh meat at home;
> today I have fulfilled my vows!
> <cite>7:15</cite> That is why I came out to meet you,
> to look for you, and I found you!
> <cite>7:16</cite> I have spread my bed with elegant coverings,
> with richly colored fabric from Egypt.
> <cite>7:17</cite> I have perfumed my bed
> with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
> <cite>7:18</cite> Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning,
> let’s delight ourselves with sexual intercourse.
> <cite>7:19</cite> For my husband is not at home;
> he has gone on a journey of some distance.
> <cite>7:20</cite> He has taken a bag of money with him;
> he will not return until the end of the month.”
> <cite>7:21</cite> She persuaded him with persuasive words;
> with her smooth speech she compelled him.
> <cite>7:22</cite> Suddenly he went after her
> like an ox that goes to the slaughter,
> like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare
> <cite>7:23</cite> till an arrow pierces his liver—
> like a bird hurrying into a trap,
> and he does not know that it will cost him his life.
> <cite>7:24</cite> So now, sons, listen to me,
> and pay attention to the words I speak.
> <cite>7:25</cite> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways;
> do not wander into her pathways;
> <cite>7:26</cite> for she has brought down many fatally wounded,
> and all those she has slain are many.
> <cite>7:27</cite> Her house is the way to the grave,
> going down to the chambers of death.

## Chapter 8

### The Appeal Of Wisdom

> <cite>8:1</cite> Does not wisdom call out?
> Does not understanding raise her voice?
> <cite>8:2</cite> At the top of the elevated places along the way,
> at the juncture of the paths she takes her stand;
> <cite>8:3</cite> beside the gates opening into the city,
> at the entrance of the doorways she cries out:
> <cite>8:4</cite> “To you, O people, I call out,
> and my voice calls to all mankind.
> <cite>8:5</cite> You who are naive, discern wisdom!
> And you fools, understand discernment!
> <cite>8:6</cite> Listen, for I will speak excellent things,
> and my lips will utter what is right.
> <cite>8:7</cite> For my mouth speaks truth,
> and my lips hate wickedness.
> <cite>8:8</cite> All the words of my mouth are righteous;
> there is nothing in them twisted or crooked.
> <cite>8:9</cite> All of them are clear to the discerning
> and upright to those who find knowledge.
> <cite>8:10</cite> Receive my instruction rather than silver,
> and knowledge rather than choice gold.
> <cite>8:11</cite> For wisdom is better than rubies,
> and desirable things cannot be compared to her.
> <cite>8:12</cite> “I, wisdom, live with prudence,
> and I find knowledge and discretion.
> <cite>8:13</cite> The fear of the Lord is to hate evil;
> I hate arrogant pride and the evil way
> and perverse utterances.
> <cite>8:14</cite> Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me;
> I possess understanding and might.
> <cite>8:15</cite> Kings reign by means of me,
> and potentates decree righteousness;
> <cite>8:16</cite> by me princes rule,
> as well as nobles and all righteous judges.
> <cite>8:17</cite> I love those who love me,
> and those who seek me find me.
> <cite>8:18</cite> Riches and honor are with me,
> long-lasting wealth and righteousness.
> <cite>8:19</cite> My fruit is better than pure gold,
> and what I produce is better than choice silver.
> <cite>8:20</cite> I walk in the path of righteousness,
> in the midst of the pathway of justice,
> <cite>8:21</cite> that I may cause those who love me to inherit righteousness,
> and fill their treasuries.
> <cite>8:22</cite> The Lord created me as the beginning of his way,
> before his works of old.
> <cite>8:23</cite> From eternity I was appointed,
> from the beginning, from before the world existed.
> <cite>8:24</cite> When there were no deep oceans I was given birth,
> when there were no springs abounding with water;
> <cite>8:25</cite> before the mountains were settled,
> before the hills, I was brought forth,
> <cite>8:26</cite> before he made the earth and its fields,
> or the beginning of the dust of the world.
> <cite>8:27</cite> When he established the heavens, I was there;

> <cite>24:1</cite> Do not envy evil people,
> do not desire to be with them;
> <cite>24:2</cite> for their hearts contemplate violence,

> <cite>24:4</cite> by knowledge its rooms are filled
> with all kinds of precious and pleasing treasures.
> <cite>24:5</cite> A wise warrior is strong,
> and a man of knowledge makes his strength stronger;
> <cite>24:6</cite> for with guidance you wage your war,

> <cite>24:7</cite> Wisdom is unattainable for a fool;

### Further Sayings of the Wise

> <cite>24:23</cite> These sayings also are from the wise:
> To show partiality in judgment is terrible:
> <cite>24:24</cite> The one who says to the guilty, “You are innocent,”
> peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him.
> <cite>24:25</cite> But there will be delight for those who rebuke them,
> and a pleasing blessing will come on them.
> <cite>24:26</cite> Like a kiss on the lips
> is the one who gives an honest answer.
> <cite>24:27</cite> Establish your work outside and get your fields ready;
> afterward build your house.
> <cite>24:28</cite> Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,
> and do not deceive with your words.
> <cite>24:29</cite> Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me;
> I will deal with him in accordance with what he has done.”
> <cite>24:30</cite> I passed by the field of a sluggard,
> by the vineyard of one who lacks wisdom.
> <cite>24:31</cite> I saw that thorns had grown up all over it,
> the ground was covered with weeds,
> and its stone wall was broken down.
> <cite>24:32</cite> When I saw this, I applied my heart;
> I received instruction from what I saw:
> <cite>24:33</cite> “A little sleep, a little slumber,
> a little folding of the hands to relax,
> <cite>24:34</cite> and your poverty will come like a robber,
> and your need like an armed man.”

### Proverbs of Solomon Collected by Hezekiah

> <cite>25:1</cite> These also are proverbs of Solomon,
> which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied:
> <cite>25:2</cite> It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
> and it is the glory of a king to search out a matter.
> <cite>25:3</cite> As the heaven is high and the earth deep
> so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
> <cite>25:4</cite> Remove the dross from the silver,
> and material for the silversmith will emerge;
> <cite>25:5</cite> remove the wicked from before the king,
> and his throne will be established in righteousness.
> <cite>25:6</cite> Do not honor yourself before the king,
> and do not stand in the place of great men;
> <cite>25:7</cite> for it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”
> than to put you lower before a prince,
> whom your eyes have seen.
> <cite>25:8</cite> Do not go out hastily to litigation,
> or what will you do after it
> when your neighbor puts you to shame?
> <cite>25:9</cite> When you argue a case with your neighbor,
> do not reveal the secret of another person,
> <cite>25:10</cite> lest the one who hears it put you to shame
> and your infamy will never go away.
> <cite>25:11</cite> Like apples of gold in settings of silver,
> so is a word skillfully spoken.
> <cite>25:12</cite> Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold,
> so is a wise reprover to the ear of the one who listens.
> <cite>25:13</cite> Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
> so is a faithful messenger to those who send him,
> for he refreshes the heart of his masters.
> <cite>25:14</cite> Like clouded skies and wind without rain,
> so is the one who boasts of a gift not given.
> <cite>25:15</cite> Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,
> and a soft tongue can break a bone.
> <cite>25:16</cite> When you find honey, eat what is sufficient for you,
> lest you should become filled with it and vomit it up.
> <cite>25:17</cite> Make your foot rare in your neighbor’s house,
> lest he become weary of you and hate you.
> <cite>25:18</cite> Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow,
> so is the one who testifies against his neighbor as a false witness.
> <cite>25:19</cite> Like a bad tooth or a foot out of joint,
> so is confidence in an unfaithful person at the time of trouble.
> <cite>25:20</cite> Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,
> or like vinegar poured in soda,
> so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
> <cite>25:21</cite> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,
> and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,
> <cite>25:22</cite> for you will heap coals of fire on his head,
> and the Lord will reward you.
> <cite>25:23</cite> The north wind brings forth rain,
> and a sly tongue brings forth an angry look.
> <cite>25:24</cite> It is better to live on a corner of the housetop
> than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.
> <cite>25:25</cite> Like cold water to a weary person,
> so is good news from a distant land.
> <cite>25:26</cite> Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,
> so is a righteous person who gives way before the wicked.
> <cite>25:27</cite> It is not good to eat too much honey,
> nor is it honorable for people to seek their own glory.
> <cite>25:28</cite> Like a city that is broken down and without a wall,
> so is a person who cannot control his temper.

## Chapter 26

> <cite>26:1</cite> Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
> so honor is not fitting for a fool.
> <cite>26:2</cite> Like a fluttering bird or like a flying swallow,
> so a causeless curse does not come to rest.
> <cite>26:3</cite> A whip for the horse and a bridle for the donkey,

> <cite>26:14</cite> Like a door that turns on its hinges,

> <cite>26:15</cite> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;

> <cite>26:16</cite> The sluggard is wiser in his own estimation

> <cite>26:17</cite> Like one who grabs a wild dog by the ears,

> <cite>26:18</cite> Like a madman who shoots

> <cite>26:19</cite> so is a person who deceives his neighbor,

> <cite>26:20</cite> Where there is no wood, a fire goes out,
> and where there is no gossip, contention dies down.
> <cite>26:21</cite> Like charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,
> so is a contentious person to kindle strife.
> <cite>26:22</cite> The words of a gossip are like delicious morsels;
> they go down into a person’s innermost being.
> <cite>26:23</cite> Like a coating of glaze over earthenware
> are fervent lips with an evil heart.
> <cite>26:24</cite> The one who hates others disguises it with his lips,

> <cite>26:25</cite> When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,
> for there are seven abominations within him.
> <cite>26:26</cite> Though his hatred may be concealed by deceit,
> his evil will be uncovered in the assembly.
> <cite>26:27</cite> The one who digs a pit will fall into it;
> the one who rolls a stone—it will come back on him.
> <cite>26:28</cite> A lying tongue hates those crushed by it,
> and a flattering mouth works ruin.

## Chapter 27

> <cite>27:1</cite> Do not boast about tomorrow;

> <cite>27:3</cite> A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,

> <cite>27:4</cite> Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,
> but who can stand before jealousy?
> <cite>27:5</cite> Better is open rebuke

> <cite>27:6</cite> Faithful are the wounds of a friend,

> <cite>27:15</cite> A continual dripping on a rainy day

## Chapter 28

> <cite>28:1</cite> The wicked person flees when there is no one pursuing,

## Chapter 29

> <cite>29:1</cite> The one who hardens his neck after numerous rebukes

### The Words of Agur

> <cite>30:1</cite> The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle;
> This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal:
> <cite>30:2</cite> Surely I am more brutish than any other man,
> and I do not have human understanding;
> <cite>30:3</cite> I have not learned wisdom,
> nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One.
> <cite>30:4</cite> Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended?
> Who has gathered up the winds in his fists?
> Who has bound up the waters in his cloak?
> Who has established all the ends of the earth?
> What is his name, and what is the name of his son? —if you know!
> <cite>30:5</cite> Every word of God is purified;
> he is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.
> <cite>30:6</cite> Do not add to his words,
> lest he reprove you, and prove you a liar.
> <cite>30:7</cite> Two things I ask from you;
> do not refuse me before I die:
> <cite>30:8</cite> Remove falsehood and lies far from me;
> do not give me poverty or riches,
> feed me with my allotted bread,
> <cite>30:9</cite> lest I become satisfied and act deceptively
> and say, “Who is the Lord?”
> or lest I become poor and steal
> and harm the name of my God.
> <cite>30:10</cite> Do not slander a servant to his master,
> lest he curse you, and you are found guilty.
> <cite>30:11</cite> There is a generation who curse their fathers
> and do not bless their mothers;
> <cite>30:12</cite> there is a generation who are pure in their own eyes
> and yet are not washed from their filthiness;
> <cite>30:13</cite> there is a generation whose eyes are so lofty,
> and whose eyelids are lifted up;
> <cite>30:14</cite> there is a generation whose teeth are like swords
> and whose great teeth are like swords
> to devour the poor from the earth
> and the needy from among the human race.
> <cite>30:15</cite> The leech has two daughters:
> “Give! Give!”
> There are three things that are never satisfied,
> four that never say, “Enough”—
> <cite>30:16</cite> the grave, the barren womb,
> land that is not satisfied with water,
> and fire that never says, “Enough!”
> <cite>30:17</cite> The eye that mocks at a father

> <cite>30:18</cite> There are three things that are too wonderful for me,
> four that I do not understand:
> <cite>30:19</cite> the way of an eagle in the sky,
> the way of a snake on a rock,
> the way of a ship in the sea,
> and the way of a man with a woman.
> <cite>30:20</cite> This is the way of an adulterous woman:
> she eats and wipes her mouth
> and says, “I have not done wrong.”
> <cite>30:21</cite> Under three things the earth trembles,

> <cite>30:22</cite> under a servant who becomes king,

> <cite>30:23</cite> under an unloved woman who is married,

> <cite>30:24</cite> There are four things on earth that are small,

> <cite>30:25</cite> ants are creatures with little strength,
> but they prepare their food in the summer;
> <cite>30:26</cite> rock badgers are creatures with little power,

> <cite>30:27</cite> locusts have no king,
> but they all go forth by ranks;
> <cite>30:28</cite> a lizard you can seize with the hand,
> but it is in the palaces of the king.
> <cite>30:29</cite> There are three things that are magnificent in their step,
> four things that move about magnificently:
> <cite>30:30</cite> a lion, mightiest of the beasts,
> who does not retreat from anything;
> <cite>30:31</cite> a strutting rooster, a male goat,
> and a king with his army around him.
> <cite>30:32</cite> If you have done foolishly in exalting yourself
> or if you have planned evil,
> put your hand over your mouth!

### The Words of Lemuel

> <cite>31:1</cite> The words of King Lemuel,
> an oracle that his mother taught him:
> <cite>31:2</cite> O my son, O son of my womb,
> O son of my vows,
> <cite>31:3</cite> Do not give your strength to women,
> nor your ways to that which ruins kings.
> <cite>31:4</cite> It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
> it is not for kings to drink wine,
> or for rulers to crave strong drink,
> <cite>31:5</cite> lest they drink and forget what is decreed,
> and remove from all the poor their rights.
> <cite>31:6</cite> Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
> and wine to those who are distressed;
> <cite>31:7</cite> let them drink and forget their poverty,
> and remember their misery no more.
> <cite>31:8</cite> Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak,
> for the legal rights of all the dying.
> <cite>31:9</cite> Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,
> and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
> The Wife of Noble Character
> <cite>31:10</cite> Who can find a wife of noble character?
> For her value is far more than rubies.
> <cite>31:11</cite> The heart of her husband has confidence in her,
> and he has no lack of gain.
> <cite>31:12</cite> She brings him good and not evil
> all the days of her life.
> <cite>31:13</cite> She obtains wool and flax,
> and she is pleased to work with her hands.
> <cite>31:14</cite> She is like the merchant ships;
> she brings her food from afar.
> <cite>31:15</cite> She also gets up while it is still night,
> and provides food for her household and a portion to her female servants.
> <cite>31:16</cite> She considers a field and buys it;
> from her own income she plants a vineyard.
> <cite>31:17</cite> She begins her work vigorously,
> and she strengthens her arms.
> <cite>31:18</cite> She knows that her merchandise is good,
> and her lamp does not go out in the night.
> <cite>31:19</cite> Her hands take hold of the distaff,
> and her hands grasp the spindle.
> <cite>31:20</cite> She extends her hand to the poor,
> and reaches out her hand to the needy.
> <cite>31:21</cite> She is not afraid of the snow for her household,
> for all of her household are clothed with scarlet.
> <cite>31:22</cite> She makes for herself coverlets;
> her clothing is fine linen and purple.
> <cite>31:23</cite> Her husband is well-known in the city gate
> when he sits with the elders of the land.
> <cite>31:24</cite> She makes linen garments and sells them,
> and supplies the merchants with sashes.
> <cite>31:25</cite> She is clothed with strength and honor,
> and she can laugh at the time to come.
> <cite>31:26</cite> She opens her mouth with wisdom,
> and loving instruction is on her tongue.
> <cite>31:27</cite> She watches over the ways of her household,
> and does not eat the bread of idleness.
> <cite>31:28</cite> Her children rise up and call her blessed,
> her husband also praises her:
> <cite>31:29</cite> “Many daughters have done valiantly,
> but you surpass them all.”
> <cite>31:30</cite> Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting,
> but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.
> <cite>31:31</cite> Give her credit for what she has accomplished,
> and let her works praise her in the city gates.
