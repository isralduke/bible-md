He is especially so to me, and even more so to you now, both humanly speaking and in the Lord. <a name="1:17">1:17</a> Therefore if you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me. <a name="1:18">1:18</a> Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything, charge what he owes to me. <a name="1:19">1:19</a> I, Paul, have written this letter with my own hand: I will repay it. I could also mention that you owe me your very self. <a name="1:20">1:20</a> Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. <a name="1:21">1:21</a> Since I was confident that you would obey, I wrote to you, because I knew that you would do even more than what I am asking you to do. <a name="1:22">1:22</a> At the same time also, prepare a place for me to stay, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.</p> <h3 id="concludinggreetings">Concluding Greetings</h3> <p><a name="1:23">1:23</a> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you. <a name="1:24">1:24</a> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my colaborers, greet you too. <a name="1:25">1:25</a> May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p> </div> </div> </div> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js?ckcachebust=591234458" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js?ckcachebust=591234458" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js?ckcachebust=591234458" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
