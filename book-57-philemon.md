## Chapter 1

<cite>1:1</cite> From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and colaborer, <cite>1:2</cite> to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house. <cite>1:3</cite> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!

### Thanks for Philemon’s Love and Faith

<cite>1:4</cite> I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, <cite>1:5</cite> because I hear of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. <cite>1:6</cite> I pray that the faith you share with us may deepen your understanding of every blessing that belongs to you in Christ. <cite>1:7</cite> I have had great joy and encouragement because of your love, for the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.

### Paul’s Request for Onesimus

<cite>1:8</cite> So, although I have quite a lot of confidence in Christ and could command you to do what is proper, <cite>1:9</cite> I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love—I, Paul, an old man and even now a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus— <cite>1:10</cite> I am appealing to you concerning my child, whose spiritual father I have become during my imprisonment, that is, Onesimus, <cite>1:11</cite> who was formerly useless to you, but is now useful to you and me. <cite>1:12</cite> I have sent him (who is my very heart) back to you. <cite>1:13</cite> I wanted to keep him so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel. <cite>1:14</cite> However, without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your good deed would not be out of compulsion, but from your own willingness. <cite>1:15</cite> For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a little while, so that you would have him back eternally, <cite>1:16</cite> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a dear brother. He is especially so to me, and even more so to you now, both humanly speaking and in the Lord. <cite>1:17</cite> Therefore if you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me. <cite>1:18</cite> Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything, charge what he owes to me. <cite>1:19</cite> I, Paul, have written this letter with my own hand: I will repay it. I could also mention that you owe me your very self. <cite>1:20</cite> Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. <cite>1:21</cite> Since I was confident that you would obey, I wrote to you, because I knew that you would do even more than what I am asking you to do. <cite>1:22</cite> At the same time also, prepare a place for me to stay, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.

### Concluding Greetings

<cite>1:23</cite> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you. <cite>1:24</cite> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my colaborers, greet you too. <cite>1:25</cite> May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
