## Book 1 (Psalm 1–41)

### Psalm 1

> <cite>1:1</cite> How happy is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked,
> or stand in the pathway with sinners,
> or sit in the assembly of arrogant fools!
> <cite>1:2</cite> Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the Lord’s commands;
> he intently studies his commands day and night.
> <cite>1:3</cite> He is like a tree planted by flowing streams;
> it yields its fruit at the proper time,
> and its leaves never fall off.
> He succeeds in everything he attempts.
> <cite>1:4</cite> Not so with the wicked!
> Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.
> <cite>1:5</cite> For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment,
> nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.
> <cite>1:6</cite> Certainly the Lord rewards the behavior of the godly,
> but the behavior of the wicked is self-destructive.

### Psalm 2

> <cite>2:1</cite> Why do the nations cause a commotion?
> Why are the countries devising plots that will fail?
> <cite>2:2</cite> The kings of the earth form a united front;
> the rulers collaborate
> against the Lord and his chosen king.
> <cite>2:3</cite> They say, “Let’s tear off the shackles they’ve put on us!
> Let’s free ourselves from their ropes!”
> <cite>2:4</cite> The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust;
> the sovereign Master taunts them.
> <cite>2:5</cite> Then he angrily speaks to them
> and terrifies them in his rage.
> <cite>2:6</cite> He says, “I myself have installed my king
> on Zion, my holy hill.”
> <cite>2:7</cite> The king says, “I will tell you what the Lord decreed. He said to me:
> ‘You are my son! This very day I have become your father!
> <cite>2:8</cite> You have only to ask me,
> and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
> the ends of the earth as your personal property.
> <cite>2:9</cite> You will break them with an iron scepter;
> you will smash them as if they were a potter’s jar.’”
> <cite>2:10</cite> So now, you kings, do what is wise!
> You rulers of the earth, submit to correction!
> <cite>2:11</cite> Serve the Lord in fear!
> Repent in terror!
> <cite>2:12</cite> Give sincere homage!
> Otherwise he will be angry,
> and you will die because of your behavior,
> when his anger quickly ignites.
> How happy are all who take shelter in him!

> <cite>3:3</cite> But you, Lord, are a shield that protects me;
> you grant me honor and give me renewed strength.
> <cite>3:4</cite> To the Lord I cried out,
> and he answered me from his holy hill. (Selah)
> <cite>3:5</cite> I rested and slept;
> I awoke, for the Lord protects me.
> <cite>3:6</cite> I am not afraid of the multitude of people
> who attack me from all directions.
> <cite>3:7</cite> Rise up, Lord!
> Deliver me, my God!

> Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place.
> Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer!
> <cite>4:2</cite> You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame?
> How long will you love what is worthless
> and search for what is deceptive? (Selah)
> <cite>4:3</cite> Realize that the Lord shows his faithful follower special favor;
> the Lord responds when I cry out to him.
> <cite>4:4</cite> Tremble with fear and do not sin!
> Do some soul-searching as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways! (Selah)
> <cite>4:5</cite> Offer the prescribed sacrifices
> and trust in the Lord!
> <cite>4:6</cite> Many say, “Who can show us anything good?”
> Smile upon us, Lord!

> my king and my God,
> for I am praying to you!
> <cite>5:3</cite> Lord, in the morning you will hear me;
> in the morning I will present my case to you and then wait expectantly for an answer.
> <cite>5:4</cite> Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil;
> evil people cannot dwell with you.
> <cite>5:5</cite> Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence;
> you hate all who behave wickedly.
> <cite>5:6</cite> You destroy liars;
> the Lord despises violent and deceitful people.
> <cite>5:7</cite> But as for me, because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house;
> I will bow down toward your holy temple as I worship you.
> <cite>5:8</cite> Lord, vindicate me as you lead me,
> because of those who wait to ambush me,
> remove the obstacles in the way in which you are guiding me!
> <cite>5:9</cite> For they do not speak the truth;
> their stomachs are like the place of destruction,
> their throats like an open grave,
> their tongues like a slippery slope leading into it.
> <cite>5:10</cite> Condemn them, O God!
> May their own schemes be their downfall!
> Drive them away because of their many acts of insurrection,
> for they have rebelled against you.
> <cite>5:11</cite> But may all who take shelter in you be happy!
> May they continually shout for joy!

> and you, Lord—how long will this go on?
> <cite>6:4</cite> Come back, Lord, rescue me!
> Deliver me because of your faithfulness!
> <cite>6:5</cite> For no one mentions your name in the realm of death,
> In Sheol who gives you thanks?
> <cite>6:6</cite> I am exhausted as I groan;
> all night long I drench my bed in tears;
> my tears saturate the cushion beneath me.
> <cite>6:7</cite> My eyes grow dim from suffering;

> <cite>7:3</cite> O Lord my God, if I have done what they say,
> or am guilty of unjust actions,
> <cite>7:4</cite> or have wronged my ally,
> or helped his lawless enemy,
> <cite>7:5</cite> may an enemy relentlessly chase me and catch me;

> and leave me lying humiliated in the dust. (Selah)
> <cite>7:6</cite> Rise up angrily, Lord!

> take once more your rightful place over them!
> <cite>7:8</cite> The Lord judges the nations.
> Vindicate me, Lord, because I am innocent,
> because I am blameless, O Exalted One!
> <cite>7:9</cite> May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end!
> But make the innocent secure,
> O just God,
> you who examine inner thoughts and motives!
> <cite>7:10</cite> The Exalted God is my shield,
> the one who delivers the morally upright.
> <cite>7:11</cite> God is a just judge;

> <cite>7:12</cite> If a person does not repent, God sharpens his sword
> and prepares to shoot his bow.

> <cite>7:15</cite> he digs a pit
> and then falls into the hole he has made.
> <cite>7:16</cite> He becomes the victim of his own destructive plans
> and experiences the violence he intended for others.

> I will sing praises to the Sovereign Lord!

> so that you might put an end to the vindictive enemy.
> <cite>8:3</cite> When I look up at the heavens, which your fingers made,

> <cite>9:20</cite> Terrify them, Lord!
> Let the nations know they are mere mortals! (Selah)

### Psalm 10

> <cite>10:1</cite> Why, Lord, do you stand far off?

> <cite>10:2</cite> The wicked arrogantly chase the oppressed;
> the oppressed are trapped by the schemes the wicked have dreamed up.

> in hidden places he kills the innocent.
> His eyes look for some unfortunate victim.
> <cite>10:9</cite> He lies in ambush in a hidden place, like a lion in a thicket;
> he lies in ambush, waiting to catch the oppressed;
> he catches the oppressed by pulling in his net.
> <cite>10:10</cite> His victims are crushed and beaten down;
> they are trapped in his sturdy nets.
> <cite>10:11</cite> He says to himself,
> “God overlooks it;
> he does not pay attention;
> he never notices.”
> <cite>10:12</cite> Rise up, Lord!
> O God, strike him down!
> Do not forget the oppressed!
> <cite>10:13</cite> Why does the wicked man reject God?
> He says to himself, “You will not hold me accountable.”
> <cite>10:14</cite> You have taken notice,
> for you always see one who inflicts pain and suffering.
> The unfortunate victim entrusts his cause to you;
> you deliver the fatherless.
> <cite>10:15</cite> Break the arm of the wicked and evil man!
> Hold him accountable for his wicked deeds,
> which he thought you would not discover.
> <cite>10:16</cite> The Lord rules forever!
> The nations are driven out of his land.
> <cite>10:17</cite> Lord, you have heard the request of the oppressed;
> you make them feel secure because you listen to their prayer.

> so that mere mortals may no longer terrorize them.

> <cite>11:3</cite> When the foundations are destroyed,

> His eyes watch;
> his eyes examine all people.
> <cite>11:5</cite> The Lord approves of the godly,
> but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence.

> and the tongue that boasts!
> <cite>12:4</cite> They say, “We speak persuasively;
> we know how to flatter and boast.

> <cite>12:5</cite> “Because of the violence done to the oppressed,
> because of the painful cries of the needy,

> <cite>17:15</cite> As for me, because I am innocent I will see your face;
> when I awake you will reveal yourself to me.

### Psalm 18

> <cite>18:1</cite> He said:
> “I love you, Lord, my source of strength!
> <cite>18:2</cite> The Lord is my high ridge, my stronghold, my deliverer.
> My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter,
> my shield, the horn that saves me, and my refuge.
> <cite>18:3</cite> I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise,
> and I was delivered from my enemies.
> <cite>18:4</cite> The waves of death engulfed me,
> the currents of chaos overwhelmed me.
> <cite>18:5</cite> The ropes of Sheol tightened around me,
> the snares of death trapped me.
> <cite>18:6</cite> In my distress I called to the Lord;
> I cried out to my God.
> From his heavenly temple he heard my voice;
> he listened to my cry for help.
> <cite>18:7</cite> The earth heaved and shook;
> the roots of the mountains trembled;
> they heaved because he was angry.
> <cite>18:8</cite> Smoke ascended from his nose;
> fire devoured as it came from his mouth;
> he hurled down fiery coals.
> <cite>18:9</cite> He made the sky sink as he descended;
> a thick cloud was under his feet.
> <cite>18:10</cite> He mounted a winged angel and flew;
> he glided on the wings of the wind.
> <cite>18:11</cite> He shrouded himself in darkness,
> in thick rain clouds.
> <cite>18:12</cite> From the brightness in front of him came
> hail and fiery coals.
> <cite>18:13</cite> The Lord thundered in the sky;
> the Sovereign One shouted.
> <cite>18:14</cite> He shot his arrows and scattered them,
> many lightning bolts and routed them.
> <cite>18:15</cite> The depths of the sea were exposed;
> the inner regions of the world were uncovered
> by your battle cry, Lord,
> by the powerful breath from your nose.
> <cite>18:16</cite> He reached down from above and grabbed me;
> he pulled me from the surging water.
> <cite>18:17</cite> He rescued me from my strong enemy,
> from those who hate me,
> for they were too strong for me.

> Then I will be blameless,
> and innocent of blatant rebellion.
> <cite>19:14</cite> May my words and my thoughts
> be acceptable in your sight,

> <cite>31:11</cite> Because of all my enemies, people disdain me;

> <cite>31:12</cite> I am forgotten, like a dead man no one thinks about;

> <cite>31:20</cite> You hide them with you, where they are safe from the attacks of men;

### Psalm 32

By David; a well-written song.

> <cite>32:1</cite> How happy is the one whose rebellious acts are forgiven,
> whose sin is pardoned!
> <cite>32:2</cite> How happy is the one whose wrongdoing the Lord does not punish,
> in whose spirit there is no deceit.
> <cite>32:3</cite> When I refused to confess my sin,
> my whole body wasted away,
> while I groaned in pain all day long.
> <cite>32:4</cite> For day and night you tormented me;
> you tried to destroy me in the intense heat of summer. (Selah)
> <cite>32:5</cite> Then I confessed my sin;
> I no longer covered up my wrongdoing.
> I said, “I will confess my rebellious acts to the Lord.”
> And then you forgave my sins. (Selah)
> <cite>32:6</cite> For this reason every one of your faithful followers should pray to you
> while there is a window of opportunity.
> Certainly when the surging water rises,
> it will not reach them.
> <cite>32:7</cite> You are my hiding place;
> you protect me from distress.
> You surround me with shouts of joy from those celebrating deliverance. (Selah)
> <cite>32:8</cite> I will instruct and teach you about how you should live.
> I will advise you as I look you in the eye.
> <cite>32:9</cite> Do not be like a stupid horse or mule,
> which will not obey you
> unless they are controlled by a bridle and bit.
> <cite>32:10</cite> An evil person suffers much pain,
> but the Lord’s faithfulness overwhelms the one who trusts in him.
> <cite>32:11</cite> Rejoice in the Lord and be happy, you who are godly!
> Shout for joy, all you who are morally upright!

### Psalm 33

> <cite>33:1</cite> You godly ones, shout for joy because of the Lord!
> It is appropriate for the morally upright to offer him praise.
> <cite>33:2</cite> Give thanks to the Lord with the harp!
> Sing to him to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument!
> <cite>33:3</cite> Sing to him a new song!
> Play skillfully as you shout out your praises to him!
> <cite>33:4</cite> For the Lord’s decrees are just,
> and everything he does is fair.
> <cite>33:5</cite> The Lord promotes equity and justice;
> the Lord’s faithfulness extends throughout the earth.
> <cite>33:6</cite> By the Lord’s decree the heavens were made;
> by a mere word from his mouth all the stars in the sky were created.
> <cite>33:7</cite> He piles up the water of the sea;
> he puts the oceans in storehouses.
> <cite>33:8</cite> Let the whole earth fear the Lord!
> Let all who live in the world stand in awe of him!
> <cite>33:9</cite> For he spoke, and it came into existence,
> he issued the decree, and it stood firm.
> <cite>33:10</cite> The Lord frustrates the decisions of the nations;
> he nullifies the plans of the peoples.
> <cite>33:11</cite> The Lord’s decisions stand forever;
> his plans abide throughout the ages.
> <cite>33:12</cite> How happy is the nation whose God is the Lord,
> the people whom he has chosen to be his special possession.
> <cite>33:13</cite> The Lord watches from heaven;
> he sees all people.
> <cite>33:14</cite> From the place where he lives he looks carefully
> at all the earth’s inhabitants.
> <cite>33:15</cite> He is the one who forms every human heart,
> and takes note of all their actions.
> <cite>33:16</cite> No king is delivered by his vast army;
> a warrior is not saved by his great might.
> <cite>33:17</cite> A horse disappoints those who trust in it for victory;
> despite its great strength, it cannot deliver.
> <cite>33:18</cite> Look, the Lord takes notice of his loyal followers,
> those who wait for him to demonstrate his faithfulness
> <cite>33:19</cite> by saving their lives from death
> and sustaining them during times of famine.
> <cite>33:20</cite> We wait for the Lord;
> he is our deliverer and shield.
> <cite>33:21</cite> For our hearts rejoice in him,
> for we trust in his holy name.
> <cite>33:22</cite> May we experience your faithfulness, O Lord,
> for we wait for you.

### Psalm 34

Written by David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, causing the king to send him away.

> <cite>34:1</cite> I will praise the Lord at all times;

> let the oppressed hear and rejoice!
> <cite>34:3</cite> Magnify the Lord with me!
> Let’s praise his name together!
> <cite>34:4</cite> I sought the Lord’s help and he answered me;

> <cite>34:6</cite> This oppressed man cried out and the Lord heard;
> he saved him from all his troubles.
> <cite>34:7</cite> The Lord’s angel camps around
> the Lord’s loyal followers and delivers them.
> <cite>34:8</cite> Taste and see that the Lord is good!
> How happy is the onewho takes shelter in him!
> <cite>34:9</cite> Remain loyal to the Lord, you chosen people of his,
> for his loyal followers lack nothing!
> <cite>34:10</cite> Even young lions sometimes lack food and are hungry,
> but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
> <cite>34:11</cite> Come children! Listen to me!
> I will teach you what it means to fear the Lord.
> <cite>34:12</cite> Do you want to really live?
> Would you love to live a long, happy life?
> <cite>34:13</cite> Then make sure you don’t speak evil words
> or use deceptive speech!
> <cite>34:14</cite> Turn away from evil and do what is right!
> Strive for peace and promote it!
> <cite>34:15</cite> The Lord pays attention to the godly
> and hears their cry for help.
> <cite>34:16</cite> But the Lord opposes evildoers
> and wipes out all memory of them from the earth.
> <cite>34:17</cite> The godly cry out and the Lord hears;
> he saves them from all their troubles.
> <cite>34:18</cite> The Lord is near the brokenhearted;
> he delivers those who are discouraged.
> <cite>34:19</cite> The godly face many dangers,
> but the Lord saves them from each one of them.
> <cite>34:20</cite> He protects all his bones;
> not one of them is broken.
> <cite>34:21</cite> Evil people self-destruct;
> those who hate the godly are punished.
> <cite>34:22</cite> The Lord rescues his servants;
> all who take shelter in him escape punishment.

### Psalm 35

By David.

> <cite>35:1</cite> O Lord, fight those who fight with me!
> Attack those who attack me!
> <cite>35:2</cite> Grab your small shield and large shield,
> and rise up to help me!
> <cite>35:3</cite> Use your spear and lance against those who chase me!
> Assure me with these words: “I am your deliverer!”
> <cite>35:4</cite> May those who seek my life be embarrassed and humiliated!
> May those who plan to harm me be turned back and ashamed!
> <cite>35:5</cite> May they be like wind-driven chaff,
> as the Lord’s angel attacks them!
> <cite>35:6</cite> May their path be dark and slippery,
> as the Lord’s angel chases them!
> <cite>35:7</cite> I did not harm them, but they hid a net to catch me
> and dug a pit to trap me.
> <cite>35:8</cite> Let destruction take them by surprise!
> Let the net they hid catch them!
> Let them fall into destruction!
> <cite>35:9</cite> Then I will rejoice in the Lord
> and be happy because of his deliverance.
> <cite>35:10</cite> With all my strength I will say,
> “O Lord, who can compare to you?
> You rescue the oppressed from those who try to overpower them;
> the oppressed and needy from those who try to rob them.”
> <cite>35:11</cite> Violent men perjure themselves,
> and falsely accuse me.
> <cite>35:12</cite> They repay me evil for the good I have done;
> I am overwhelmed with sorrow.
> <cite>35:13</cite> When they were sick, I wore sackcloth,
> and refrained from eating food.
(If I am lying, may my prayers go unanswered!)
> <cite>35:14</cite> I mourned for them as I would for a friend or my brother.
> I bowed down in sorrow as if I were mourning for my mother.
> <cite>35:15</cite> But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;
> they gathered together to ambush me.
> They tore at me without stopping to rest.
> <cite>35:16</cite> When I tripped, they taunted me relentlessly,
> and tried to bite me.
> <cite>35:17</cite> O sovereign Master, how long are you going to just stand there and watch this?
> Rescue me from their destructive attacks;
> guard my life from the young lions!
> <cite>35:18</cite> Then I will give you thanks in the great assembly;
> I will praise you before a large crowd of people!
> <cite>35:19</cite> Do not let those who are my enemies for no reason gloat over me!
> Do not let those who hate me without cause carry out their wicked schemes!
> <cite>35:20</cite> For they do not try to make peace with others,
> but plan ways to deceive those who are unsuspecting.
> <cite>35:21</cite> They are ready to devour me;
> they say, “Aha! Aha! We’ve got you!”
> <cite>35:22</cite> But you take notice, Lord!
> O sovereign Master, do not remain far away from me!
> <cite>35:23</cite> Rouse yourself, wake up and vindicate me!
> My God and Lord, defend my just cause!
> <cite>35:24</cite> Vindicate me by your justice, O Lord my God!
> Do not let them gloat over me!
> <cite>35:25</cite> Do not let them say to themselves, “Aha! We have what we wanted!”
> Do not let them say, “We have devoured him!”
> <cite>35:26</cite> May those who want to harm me be totally embarrassed and ashamed!
> May those who arrogantly taunt me be covered with shame and humiliation!
> <cite>35:27</cite> May those who desire my vindication shout for joy and rejoice!
> May they continually say, “May the Lord be praised, for he wants his servant to be secure.”
> <cite>35:28</cite> Then I will tell others about your justice,
> and praise you all day long.

### Psalm 36

For the music director; written by the Lord’s servant, David; an oracle.

> <cite>36:1</cite> An evil man is rebellious to the core.
> He does not fear God,
> <cite>36:2</cite> for he is too proud
> to recognize and give up his sin.
> <cite>36:3</cite> The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful;
> he does not care about doing what is wise and right.
> <cite>36:4</cite> He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed;
> he is committed to a sinful lifestyle;
> he does not reject what is evil.
> <cite>36:5</cite> O Lord, your loyal love reaches to the sky;
> your faithfulness to the clouds.
> <cite>36:6</cite> Your justice is like the highest mountains,
> your fairness like the deepest sea;
> you preserve mankind and the animal kingdom.
> <cite>36:7</cite> How precious is your loyal love, O God!
> The human race finds shelter under your wings.
> <cite>36:8</cite> They are filled with food from your house,
> and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies.
> <cite>36:9</cite> For you are the one who gives
> and sustains life.
> <cite>36:10</cite> Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers,
> and vindicate the morally upright!
> <cite>36:11</cite> Do not let arrogant men overtake me,
> or let evil men make me homeless!
> <cite>36:12</cite> I can see the evildoers! They have fallen!
> They have been knocked down and are unable to get up!

### Psalm 37

By David.

> <cite>37:1</cite> Do not fret when wicked men seem to succeed!
> Do not envy evildoers!
> <cite>37:2</cite> For they will quickly dry up like grass,
> and wither away like plants.
> <cite>37:3</cite> Trust in the Lord and do what is right!
> Settle in the land and maintain your integrity!
> <cite>37:4</cite> Then you will take delight in the Lord,
> and he will answer your prayers.
> <cite>37:5</cite> Commit your future to the Lord!
> Trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.
> <cite>37:6</cite> He will vindicate you in broad daylight,
> and publicly defend your just cause.
> <cite>37:7</cite> Wait patiently for the Lord!
> Wait confidently for him!
> Do not fret over the apparent success of a sinner,
> a man who carries out wicked schemes!
> <cite>37:8</cite> Do not be angry and frustrated!
> Do not fret! That only leads to trouble!
> <cite>37:9</cite> Wicked men will be wiped out,
> but those who rely on the Lord are the ones who will possess the land.
> <cite>37:10</cite> Evil men will soon disappear;
> you will stare at the spot where they once were, but they will be gone.
> <cite>37:11</cite> But the oppressed will possess the land
> and enjoy great prosperity.
> <cite>37:12</cite> Evil men plot against the godly
> and viciously attack them.
> <cite>37:13</cite> The sovereign Master laughs in disgust at them,
> for he knows that their day is coming.
> <cite>37:14</cite> Evil men draw their swords
> and prepare their bows,
> to bring down the oppressed and needy,
> and to slaughter those who are godly.
> <cite>37:15</cite> Their swords will pierce their own hearts,
> and their bows will be broken.
> <cite>37:16</cite> The little bit that a godly man owns is better than
> the wealth of many evil men,
> <cite>37:17</cite> for evil men will lose their power,
> but the Lord sustains the godly.
> <cite>37:18</cite> The Lord watches over the innocent day by day
> and they possess a permanent inheritance.
> <cite>37:19</cite> They will not be ashamed when hard times come;
> when famine comes they will have enough to eat.
> <cite>37:20</cite> But evil men will die;
> the Lord’s enemies will be incinerated—
> they will go up in smoke.
> <cite>37:21</cite> Evil men borrow, but do not repay their debt,
> but the godly show compassion and are generous.
> <cite>37:22</cite> Surely those favored by the Lord will possess the land,
> but those rejected by him will be wiped out.
> <cite>37:23</cite> The Lord grants success to the one
> whose behavior he finds commendable.
> <cite>37:24</cite> Even if he trips, he will not fall headlong,
> for the Lord holds his hand.
> <cite>37:25</cite> I was once young, now I am old.
> I have never seen a godly man abandoned,
> or his children forced to search for food.
> <cite>37:26</cite> All day long he shows compassion and lends to others,
> and his children are blessed.
> <cite>37:27</cite> Turn away from evil! Do what is right!
> Then you will enjoy lasting security.
> <cite>37:28</cite> For the Lord promotes justice,
> and never abandons his faithful followers.
> They are permanently secure,
> but the children of evil men are wiped out.
> <cite>37:29</cite> The godly will possess the land
> and will dwell in it permanently.
> <cite>37:30</cite> The godly speak wise words
> and promote justice.
> <cite>37:31</cite> The law of their God controls their thinking;
> their feet do not slip.
> <cite>37:32</cite> Evil men set an ambush for the godly
> and try to kill them.
> <cite>37:33</cite> But the Lord does not surrender the godly,
> or allow them to be condemned in a court of law.
> <cite>37:34</cite> Rely on the Lord! Obey his commands!
> Then he will permit you to possess the land;
> you will see the demise of evil men.
> <cite>37:35</cite> I have seen ruthless evil men
> growing in influence, like a green tree grows in its native soil.
> <cite>37:36</cite> But then one passes by, and suddenly they have disappeared!
> I looked for them, but they could not be found.
> <cite>37:37</cite> Take note of the one who has integrity! Observe the godly!
> For the one who promotes peace has a future.
> <cite>37:38</cite> Sinful rebels are totally destroyed;
> evil men have no future.
> <cite>37:39</cite> But the Lord delivers the godly;
> he protects them in times of trouble.
> <cite>37:40</cite> The Lord helps them and rescues them;
> he rescues them from evil men and delivers them,
> for they seek his protection.

### Psalm 38

A psalm of David, written to get God’s attention.

> <cite>38:1</cite> O Lord, do not continue to rebuke me in your anger!
> Do not continue to punish me in your raging fury!
> <cite>38:2</cite> For your arrows pierce me,
> and your hand presses me down.
> <cite>38:3</cite> My whole body is sick because of your judgment;
> I am deprived of health because of my sin.
> <cite>38:4</cite> For my sins overwhelm me;
> like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear.
> <cite>38:5</cite> My wounds are infected and starting to smell,
> because of my foolish sins.
> <cite>38:6</cite> I am dazed and completely humiliated;
> all day long I walk around mourning.
> <cite>38:7</cite> For I am overcome with shame
> and my whole body is sick.
> <cite>38:8</cite> I am numb with pain and severely battered;
> I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel.
> <cite>38:9</cite> O sovereign Master, you understand my heart’s desire;
> my groaning is not hidden from you.
> <cite>38:10</cite> My heart beats quickly;
> my strength leaves me;
> I can hardly see.
> <cite>38:11</cite> Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance;
> my neighbors stand far away.
> <cite>38:12</cite> Those who seek my life try to entrap me;
> those who want to harm me speak destructive words;
> all day long they say deceitful things.
> <cite>38:13</cite> But I am like a deaf man—I hear nothing;
> I am like a mute who cannot speak.
> <cite>38:14</cite> I am like a man who cannot hear
> and is incapable of arguing his defense.
> <cite>38:15</cite> Yet I wait for you, O Lord!
> You will respond, O sovereign Master, my God!
> <cite>38:16</cite> I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me;
> when my foot slips they will arrogantly taunt me.
> <cite>38:17</cite> For I am about to stumble,
> and I am in constant pain.
> <cite>38:18</cite> Yes, I confess my wrongdoing,
> and I am concerned about my sins.
> <cite>38:19</cite> But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous;
> those who hate me without cause outnumber me.
> <cite>38:20</cite> They repay me evil for the good I have done;
> though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at me.
> <cite>38:21</cite> Do not abandon me, O Lord!
> My God, do not remain far away from me!
> <cite>38:22</cite> Hurry and help me, O sovereign Master, my deliverer!

### Psalm 39

For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of David.

> <cite>39:1</cite> I decided, “I will watch what I say
> and make sure I do not sin with my tongue.
> I will put a muzzle over my mouth
> while in the presence of an evil man.”
> <cite>39:2</cite> I was stone silent;
> I held back the urge to speak.
> My frustration grew;
> <cite>39:3</cite> my anxiety intensified.
> As I thought about it, I became impatient.
> Finally I spoke these words:
> <cite>39:4</cite> “O Lord, help me understand my mortality
> and the brevity of life!
> Let me realize how quickly my life will pass!
> <cite>39:5</cite> Look, you make my days short-lived,
> and my life span is nothing from your perspective.
> Surely all people, even those who seem secure, are nothing but vapor.
> <cite>39:6</cite> Surely people go through life as mere ghosts.
> Surely they accumulate worthless wealth
> without knowing who will eventually haul it away.”
> <cite>39:7</cite> But now, O sovereign Master, upon what am I relying?
> You are my only hope!
> <cite>39:8</cite> Deliver me from all my sins of rebellion!
> Do not make me the object of fools’ insults!
> <cite>39:9</cite> I am silent and cannot open my mouth
> because of what you have done.
> <cite>39:10</cite> Please stop wounding me!
> You have almost beaten me to death!
> <cite>39:11</cite> You severely discipline people for their sins;
> like a moth you slowly devour their strength.
> Surely all people are a mere vapor. (Selah)
> <cite>39:12</cite> Hear my prayer, O Lord!
> Listen to my cry for help!
> Do not ignore my sobbing!
> For I am dependent on you, like one residing outside his native land;
> I am at your mercy, just as all my ancestors were.
> <cite>39:13</cite> Turn your angry gaze away from me, so I can be happy
> before I pass away.

> out of the slimy mud.
> He placed my feet on a rock
> and gave me secure footing.
> <cite>40:3</cite> He gave me reason to sing a new song,
> praising our God.
> May many see what God has done,
> so that they might swear allegiance to him and trust in the Lord!
> <cite>40:4</cite> How happy is the one who trusts in the Lord
> and does not seek help from the proud or from liars!
> <cite>40:5</cite> O Lord, my God, you have accomplished many things;
> you have done amazing things and carried out your purposes for us.
> No one can thwart you!
> I want to declare them and talk about them,
> but they are too numerous to recount!
> <cite>40:6</cite> Receiving sacrifices and offerings are not your primary concern.
> You make that quite clear to me!
> You do not ask for burnt sacrifices and sin offerings.
> <cite>40:7</cite> Then I say,
> “Look! I come!
> What is written in the scroll pertains to me.
> <cite>40:8</cite> I want to do what pleases you, my God.
> Your law dominates my thoughts.”
> <cite>40:9</cite> I have told the great assembly about your justice.
> Look! I spare no words!
> O Lord, you know this is true.
> <cite>40:10</cite> I have not failed to tell about your justice;
> I spoke about your reliability and deliverance;
> I have not neglected to tell the great assembly about your loyal love and faithfulness.
> <cite>40:11</cite> O Lord, you do not withhold your compassion from me.
> May your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me!
> <cite>40:12</cite> For innumerable dangers surround me.

> so my strength fails me.
> <cite>40:13</cite> Please be willing, O Lord, to rescue me!
> O Lord, hurry and help me!
> <cite>40:14</cite> May those who are trying to snatch away my life
> be totally embarrassed and ashamed!
> May those who want to harm me
> be turned back and ashamed!
> <cite>40:15</cite> May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”
> be humiliated and disgraced!
> <cite>40:16</cite> May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you!
> May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually,
> “May the Lord be praised!”
> <cite>40:17</cite> I am oppressed and needy!

### Psalm 42

For the music director; a well-written song by the Korahites.

> <cite>42:1</cite> As a deer longs for streams of water,
> so I long for you, O God!
> <cite>42:2</cite> I thirst for God,
> for the living God.
> I say, “When will I be able to go and appear in God’s presence?”
> <cite>42:3</cite> I cannot eat, I weep day and night;
> all day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”
> <cite>42:4</cite> I will remember and weep!
> For I was once walking along with the great throng to the temple of God,
> shouting and giving thanks along with the crowd as we celebrated the holy festival.
> <cite>42:5</cite> Why are you depressed, O my soul?
> Why are you upset?
> Wait for God!
> For I will again give thanks
> to my God for his saving intervention.
> <cite>42:6</cite> I am depressed,
> so I will pray to you while I am trapped here in the region of the upper Jordan,
> from Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
> <cite>42:7</cite> One deep stream calls out to another at the sound of your waterfalls;
> all your billows and waves overwhelm me.
> <cite>42:8</cite> By day the Lord decrees his loyal love,
> and by night he gives me a song,
> a prayer to the living God.
> <cite>42:9</cite> I will pray to God, my high ridge:
> “Why do you ignore me?
> Why must I walk around mourning
> because my enemies oppress me?”
> <cite>42:10</cite> My enemies’ taunts cut into me to the bone,
> as they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
> <cite>42:11</cite> Why are you depressed, O my soul?
> Why are you upset?
> Wait for God!
> For I will again give thanks
> to my God for his saving intervention.

### Psalm 43

> <cite>43:1</cite> Vindicate me, O God!
> Fight for me against an ungodly nation!
> Deliver me from deceitful and evil men!
> <cite>43:2</cite> For you are the God who shelters me.
> Why do you reject me?
> Why must I walk around mourning
> because my enemies oppress me?
> <cite>43:3</cite> Reveal your light and your faithfulness!
> They will lead me,
> they will escort me back to your holy hill,
> and to the place where you live.
> <cite>43:4</cite> Then I will go to the altar of God,
> to the God who gives me ecstatic joy,
> so that I express my thanks to you, O God, my God, with a harp.
> <cite>43:5</cite> Why are you depressed, O my soul?
> Why are you upset?
> Wait for God!
> For I will again give thanks
> to my God for his saving intervention.

### Psalm 44

For the music director; by the Korahites, a well-written song.

> <cite>44:1</cite> O God, we have clearly heard;
> our ancestors have told us
> what you did in their days,
> in ancient times.
> <cite>44:2</cite> You, by your power, defeated nations and settled our fathers on their land;
> you crushed the people living there and enabled our ancestors to occupy it.
> <cite>44:3</cite> For they did not conquer the land by their swords,
> and they did not prevail by their strength,
> but rather by your power, strength and good favor,
> for you were partial to them.
> <cite>44:4</cite> You are my king, O God!
> Decree Jacob’s deliverance!
> <cite>44:5</cite> By your power we will drive back our enemies;
> by your strength we will trample down our foes!
> <cite>44:6</cite> For I do not trust in my bow,
> and I do not prevail by my sword.
> <cite>44:7</cite> For you deliver us from our enemies;
> you humiliate those who hate us.
> <cite>44:8</cite> In God I boast all day long,
> and we will continually give thanks to your name. (Selah)
> <cite>44:9</cite> But you rejected and embarrassed us!
> You did not go into battle with our armies.
> <cite>44:10</cite> You made us retreat from the enemy.
> Those who hate us take whatever they want from us.
> <cite>44:11</cite> You handed us over like sheep to be eaten;
> you scattered us among the nations.
> <cite>44:12</cite> You sold your people for a pittance;
> you did not ask a high price for them.
> <cite>44:13</cite> You made us an object of disdain to our neighbors;
> those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.
> <cite>44:14</cite> You made us an object of ridicule among the nations;
> foreigners treat us with contempt.
> <cite>44:15</cite> All day long I feel humiliated
> and am overwhelmed with shame,
> <cite>44:16</cite> before the vindictive enemy
> who ridicules and insults me.
> <cite>44:17</cite> All this has happened to us, even though we have not rejected you
> or violated your covenant with us.
> <cite>44:18</cite> We have not been unfaithful,
> nor have we disobeyed your commands.
> <cite>44:19</cite> Yet you have battered us, leaving us a heap of ruins overrun by wild dogs;
> you have covered us with darkness.
> <cite>44:20</cite> If we had rejected our God,
> and spread out our hands in prayer to another god,
> <cite>44:21</cite> would not God discover it,
> for he knows one’s thoughts?
> <cite>44:22</cite> Yet because of you we are killed all day long;
> we are treated like sheep at the slaughtering block.
> <cite>44:23</cite> Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O sovereign Master?
> Wake up! Do not reject us forever!
> <cite>44:24</cite> Why do you look the other way,
> and ignore the way we are oppressed and mistreated?
> <cite>44:25</cite> For we lie in the dirt,
> with our bellies pressed to the ground.
> <cite>44:26</cite> Rise up and help us!
> Rescue us because of your loyal love!

> Ride forth for the sake of what is right,
> on behalf of justice!
> Then your right hand will accomplish mighty acts!
> <cite>45:5</cite> Your arrows are sharp
> and penetrate the hearts of the king’s enemies.
> Nations fall at your feet.
> <cite>45:6</cite> Your throne, O God, is permanent.
> The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.
> <cite>45:7</cite> You love justice and hate evil.
> For this reason God, your God has anointed you
> with the oil of joy, elevating you above your companions.
> <cite>45:8</cite> All your garments are perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cassia.
> From the luxurious palaces comes the music of stringed instruments that makes you happy.
> <cite>45:9</cite> Princesses are among your honored guests,
> your bride stands at your right hand, wearing jewelry made with gold from Ophir.
> <cite>45:10</cite> Listen, O princess!
> Observe and pay attention!
> Forget your homeland and your family!
> <cite>45:11</cite> Then the king will be attracted by your beauty.
> After all, he is your master! Submit to him!
> <cite>45:12</cite> Rich people from Tyre
> will seek your favor by bringing a gift.
> <cite>45:13</cite> The princess looks absolutely magnificent,
> decked out in pearls and clothed in a brocade trimmed with gold.
> <cite>45:14</cite> In embroidered robes she is escorted to the king.
> Her attendants, the maidens of honor who follow her,
> are led before you.
> <cite>45:15</cite> They are bubbling with joy as they walk in procession
> and enter the royal palace.
> <cite>45:16</cite> Your sons will carry on the dynasty of your ancestors;

> and the mountains tumble into the depths of the sea,
> <cite>46:3</cite> when its waves crash and foam,
> and the mountains shake before the surging sea. (Selah)
> <cite>46:4</cite> The irrigation canals flowing from the river bring joy to the city of God,

> <cite>48:1</cite> The Lord is great and certainly worthy of praise
> in the city of our God, his holy hill.
> <cite>48:2</cite> It is lofty and pleasing to look at,
> a source of joy to the whole earth.
> Mount Zion resembles the peaks of Zaphon;
> it is the city of the great king.
> <cite>48:3</cite> God is in its fortresses;
> he reveals himself as its defender.
> <cite>48:4</cite> For look, the kings assemble;
> they advance together.
> <cite>48:5</cite> As soon as they see, they are shocked;
> they are terrified, they quickly retreat.
> <cite>48:6</cite> Look at them shake uncontrollably,
> like a woman writhing in childbirth.
> <cite>48:7</cite> With an east wind
> you shatter the large ships.
> <cite>48:8</cite> We heard about God’s mighty deeds, now we have seen them,
> in the city of the Lord, the invincible Warrior,
> in the city of our God.
> God makes it permanently secure. (Selah)
> <cite>48:9</cite> We reflect on your loyal love, O God,

> <cite>48:10</cite> The praise you receive as far away as the ends of the earth
> is worthy of your reputation, O God.
> You execute justice!
> <cite>48:11</cite> Mount Zion rejoices;
> the towns of Judah are happy,
> because of your acts of judgment.
> <cite>48:12</cite> Walk around Zion! Encircle it!
> Count its towers!

### Psalm 49

For the music director, a psalm by the Korahites.

> <cite>49:1</cite> Listen to this, all you nations!
> Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the world!
> <cite>49:2</cite> Pay attention, all you people,
> both rich and poor!
> <cite>49:3</cite> I will declare a wise saying;
> I will share my profound thoughts.
> <cite>49:4</cite> I will learn a song that imparts wisdom;
> I will then sing my insightful song to the accompaniment of a harp.
> <cite>49:5</cite> Why should I be afraid in times of trouble,
> when the sinful deeds of deceptive men threaten to overwhelm me?
> <cite>49:6</cite> They trust in their wealth
> and boast in their great riches.
> <cite>49:7</cite> Certainly a man cannot rescue his brother;
> he cannot pay God an adequate ransom price
> <cite>49:8</cite> (the ransom price for a human life is too high,
> and people go to their final destiny),
> <cite>49:9</cite> so that he might continue to live forever
> and not experience death.
> <cite>49:10</cite> Surely one sees that even wise people die;
> fools and spiritually insensitive people all pass away
> and leave their wealth to others.
> <cite>49:11</cite> Their grave becomes their permanent residence,
> their eternal dwelling place.
> They name their lands after themselves,
> <cite>49:12</cite> but, despite their wealth, people do not last,
> they are like animals that perish.
> <cite>49:13</cite> This is the destiny of fools,
> and of those who approve of their philosophy. (Selah)
> <cite>49:14</cite> They will travel to Sheol like sheep,
> with death as their shepherd.
> The godly will rule over them when the day of vindication dawns;
> Sheol will consume their bodies and they will no longer live in impressive houses.
> <cite>49:15</cite> But God will rescue my life from the power of Sheol;
> certainly he will pull me to safety. (Selah)
> <cite>49:16</cite> Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich
> and his wealth multiplies!
> <cite>49:17</cite> For he will take nothing with him when he dies;
> his wealth will not follow him down into the grave.
> <cite>49:18</cite> He pronounces this blessing on himself while he is alive:
> “May men praise you, for you have done well!”
> <cite>49:19</cite> But he will join his ancestors;
> they will never again see the light of day.
> <cite>49:20</cite> Wealthy people do not understand;
> they are like animals that perish.

### Psalm 50

A psalm by Asaph.

> <cite>50:1</cite> El, God, the Lord speaks,
> and summons the earth to come from the east and west.
> <cite>50:2</cite> From Zion, the most beautiful of all places,
> God comes in splendor.
> <cite>50:3</cite> Our God approaches and is not silent;
> consuming fire goes ahead of him
> and all around him a storm rages.
> <cite>50:4</cite> He summons the heavens above,
> as well as the earth, so that he might judge his people.
> <cite>50:5</cite> He says:
> “Assemble my covenant people before me,
> those who ratified a covenant with me by sacrifice!”
> <cite>50:6</cite> The heavens declare his fairness,
> for God is judge. (Selah)
> <cite>50:7</cite> He says:
> “Listen my people! I am speaking!
> Listen Israel! I am accusing you!
> I am God, your God!
> <cite>50:8</cite> I am not condemning you because of your sacrifices,
> or because of your burnt sacrifices that you continually offer me.
> <cite>50:9</cite> I do not need to take a bull from your household
> or goats from your sheepfolds.
> <cite>50:10</cite> For every wild animal in the forest belongs to me,
> as well as the cattle that graze on a thousand hills.
> <cite>50:11</cite> I keep track of every bird in the hills,
> and the insects of the field are mine.
> <cite>50:12</cite> Even if I were hungry, I would not tell you,
> for the world and all it contains belong to me.
> <cite>50:13</cite> Do I eat the flesh of bulls?
> Do I drink the blood of goats?
> <cite>50:14</cite> Present to God a thank-offering!
> Repay your vows to the Sovereign One!
> <cite>50:15</cite> Pray to me when you are in trouble!
> I will deliver you and vindicate you!”
> <cite>50:16</cite> God says this to the evildoer:
> “How can you declare my commands,
> and talk about my covenant?
> <cite>50:17</cite> For you hate instruction
> and reject my words.
> <cite>50:18</cite> When you see a thief, you join him;
> you associate with men who are unfaithful to their wives.
> <cite>50:19</cite> You do damage with words,
> and use your tongue to deceive.
> <cite>50:20</cite> You plot against your brother;
> you slander your own brother.
> <cite>50:21</cite> When you did these things, I was silent,
> so you thought I was exactly like you.
> But now I will condemn you
> and state my case against you!
> <cite>50:22</cite> Carefully consider this, you who reject God!
> Otherwise I will rip you to shreds
> and no one will be able to rescue you.
> <cite>50:23</cite> Whoever presents a thank-offering honors me.
> To whoever obeys my commands, I will reveal my power to deliver.”

### Psalm 51

For the music director; a psalm of David, written when Nathan the prophet confronted him after David’s affair with Bathsheba.

> <cite>51:1</cite> Have mercy on me, O God, because of your loyal love!
> Because of your great compassion, wipe away my rebellious acts!
> <cite>51:2</cite> Scrub away my wrongdoing!
> Cleanse me of my sin!
> <cite>51:3</cite> For I am aware of my rebellious acts;
> I am forever conscious of my sin.
> <cite>51:4</cite> Against you, especially you, I have sinned;
> I have done what is sinful in your sight.
> So you are just when you confront me;
> you are right when you condemn me.
> <cite>51:5</cite> Look, I was prone to do wrong from birth;
> I was a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.
> <cite>51:6</cite> Look, you desire integrity in the inner man;
> you want me to possess wisdom.
> <cite>51:7</cite> Sprinkle me with water and I will be pure;
> wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
> <cite>51:8</cite> Give me the ecstatic joy of being forgiven!
> May the bones you crushed rejoice!
> <cite>51:9</cite> Hide your face from my sins!
> Wipe away all my wrong acts!
> <cite>51:10</cite> Create for me a pure heart!
> Transform me and give me integrity!
> <cite>51:11</cite> Do not reject me!
> Do not take your Holy Spirit away from me!
> <cite>51:12</cite> Let me again experience the joy of your deliverance!
> Sustain me by giving me the desire to obey!
> <cite>51:13</cite> Then I will teach rebels your merciful ways,
> and sinners will turn to you.
> <cite>51:14</cite> Rescue me from the guilt of murder, O God, the God who delivers me!
> Then my tongue will shout for joy because of your deliverance.
> <cite>51:15</cite> O sovereign Master, give me reason to celebrate!
> Then my mouth will praise you.
> <cite>51:16</cite> Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it;
> you do not desire a burnt sacrifice.
> <cite>51:17</cite> The “sacrifices” God desires are a humble attitude—
> O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject.
> <cite>51:18</cite> Be favorably disposed to Zion!
> Build the walls of Jerusalem!
> <cite>51:19</cite> Then you will accept the proper sacrifices, burnt sacrifices and whole offerings;
> then bulls will be sacrificed on your altar.

### Psalm 52

For the music director; a well-written song by David. It was written when Doeg the Edomite went and informed Saul: “David has arrived at the home of Ahimelech.”

> <cite>52:1</cite> Why do you boast about your evil plans, O powerful man?
> God’s loyal love protects me all day long!
> <cite>52:2</cite> Your tongue carries out your destructive plans;
> it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver.
> <cite>52:3</cite> You love evil more than good,
> lies more than speaking the truth. (Selah)
> <cite>52:4</cite> You love to use all the words that destroy,
> and the tongue that deceives.
> <cite>52:5</cite> Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins.
> He will scoop you up and remove you from your home;
> he will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)
> <cite>52:6</cite> When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe,
> and will mock the evildoer, saying:
> <cite>52:7</cite> “Look, here is the man who would not make God his protector!
> He trusted in his great wealth
> and was confident about his plans to destroy others.”
> <cite>52:8</cite> But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God;
> I continually trust in God’s loyal love.
> <cite>52:9</cite> I will continually thank you when you execute judgment;
> I will rely on you, for your loyal followers know you are good.

### Psalm 53

For the music director; according to the machalath style; a well-written song by David.

> <cite>53:1</cite> Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.”
> They sin and commit evil deeds;
> none of them does what is right.
> <cite>53:2</cite> God looks down from heaven at the human race,
> to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.
> <cite>53:3</cite> Everyone rejects God;
> they are all morally corrupt.
> None of them does what is right,
> not even one!
> <cite>53:4</cite> All those who behave wickedly do not understand—
> those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,
> and do not call out to God.
> <cite>53:5</cite> They are absolutely terrified,
> even by things that do not normally cause fear.
> For God annihilates those who attack you.
> You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them.
> <cite>53:6</cite> I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!
> When God restores the well-being of his people,
> may Jacob rejoice,
> may Israel be happy!

### Psalm 54

For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a well-written song by David. It was written when the Ziphites came and informed Saul: “David is hiding with us.”

> Vindicate me by your power!
> <cite>54:2</cite> O God, listen to my prayer!
> Pay attention to what I say!
> <cite>54:3</cite> For foreigners attack me;
> ruthless men, who do not respect God, seek my life. (Selah)
> <cite>54:4</cite> Look, God is my deliverer!
> The sovereign Master is among those who support me.
> <cite>54:5</cite> May those who wait to ambush me be repaid for their evil!
> As a demonstration of your faithfulness, destroy them!
> <cite>54:6</cite> With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you!
> I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good!
> <cite>54:7</cite> Surely he rescues me from all trouble,
> and I triumph over my enemies.

For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a well-written song by David.

> <cite>55:1</cite> Listen, O God, to my prayer!

> <cite>55:2</cite> Pay attention to me and answer me!
> I am so upset and distressed, I am beside myself,
> <cite>55:3</cite> because of what the enemy says,
> and because of how the wicked pressure me,
> for they hurl trouble down upon me
> and angrily attack me.
> <cite>55:4</cite> My heart beats violently within me;
> the horrors of death overcome me.
> <cite>55:5</cite> Fear and panic overpower me;
> terror overwhelms me.

> God scatters the nations that like to do battle.
> <cite>68:31</cite> They come with red cloth from Egypt,

### Psalm 69

For the music director; according to the tune of “Lilies;” by David.

> <cite>69:1</cite> Deliver me, O God,
> for the water has reached my neck.
> <cite>69:2</cite> I sink into the deep mire
> where there is no solid ground;
> I am in deep water,
> and the current overpowers me.
> <cite>69:3</cite> I am exhausted from shouting for help;
> my throat is sore;
> my eyes grow tired of looking for my God.
> <cite>69:4</cite> Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head.
> Those who want to destroy me and are my enemies for no reason outnumber me.
> They make me “pay back” what I did not steal!
> <cite>69:5</cite> O God, you are aware of my foolish sins;
> my faults are not hidden from you.
> <cite>69:6</cite> Let none who rely on you be embarrassed because of me,
> O sovereign Lord and king!
> Let none who seek you be ashamed because of me,
> O God of Israel!
> <cite>69:7</cite> For I suffer humiliation for your sake
> and am thoroughly disgraced.
> <cite>69:8</cite> My own brothers treat me like a stranger;
> they act as if I were a foreigner.
> <cite>69:9</cite> Certainly devotion to your temple consumes me;
> I endure the insults of those who insult you.
> <cite>69:10</cite> I weep and refrain from eating food,
> which causes others to insult me.
> <cite>69:11</cite> I wear sackcloth
> and they ridicule me.
> <cite>69:12</cite> Those who sit at the city gate talk about me;
> drunkards mock me in their songs.
> <cite>69:13</cite> O Lord, may you hear my prayer and be favorably disposed to me!
> O God, because of your great loyal love, answer me;
> deliver me because of your faithfulness!
> <cite>69:14</cite> Rescue me from the mud! Don’t let me sink!
> Deliver me from those who hate me,
> from the deep water!
> <cite>69:15</cite> Don’t let the current overpower me!
> Don’t let the deep swallow me up!
> Don’t let the pit devour me!
> <cite>69:16</cite> Answer me, O Lord, for your loyal love is what I need!
> Because of your great compassion, turn toward me!
> <cite>69:17</cite> Do not ignore your servant,
> for I am in trouble! Answer me right away!
> <cite>69:18</cite> Come near me and defend me!
> Because of my enemies, rescue me!
> <cite>69:19</cite> You know how I am insulted, humiliated and disgraced;
> you can see all my enemies.
> <cite>69:20</cite> Their insults are painful and make me lose heart;
> I look for sympathy, but receive none,
> for comforters, but find none.
> <cite>69:21</cite> They put a poisonous herb into my food,
> and to quench my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.
> <cite>69:22</cite> May their dining table become a trap before them!
> May it be a snare for that group of friends!
> <cite>69:23</cite> May their eyes be blinded!
> Make them incapable of standing up!
> <cite>69:24</cite> Pour out your judgment on them!
> May your raging anger overtake them!
> <cite>69:25</cite> May their camp become desolate!
> May no one be left alive in their tents!
> <cite>69:26</cite> For they harass the one whom you discipline;
> they spread the news about the suffering of those whom you punish.
> <cite>69:27</cite> Hold them accountable for all their sins!
> Do not vindicate them!
> <cite>69:28</cite> May their names be wiped out of the scroll listing the living!
> Do not let their names be listed with the godly!
> <cite>69:29</cite> I am oppressed and suffering!
> O God, deliver and protect me!
> <cite>69:30</cite> I will sing praises to God’s name!
> I will magnify him as I give him thanks!
> <cite>69:31</cite> That will please the Lord more than an ox or a bull
> with horns and hooves.
> <cite>69:32</cite> The oppressed look on—let them rejoice!
> You who seek God, may you be encouraged!
> <cite>69:33</cite> For the Lord listens to the needy;
> he does not despise those whom he punishes.
> <cite>69:34</cite> Let the heavens and the earth praise him,
> along with the seas and everything that swims in them!
> <cite>69:35</cite> For God will deliver Zion
> and rebuild the cities of Judah,
> and his people will again live in them and possess Zion.
> <cite>69:36</cite> The descendants of his servants will inherit it,
> and those who are loyal to him will live in it.

### Psalm 70

For the music director; by David; written to get God’s attention.

> <cite>70:2</cite> May those who are trying to take my life
> be embarrassed and ashamed!
> May those who want to harm me
> be turned back and ashamed!
> <cite>70:3</cite> May those who say, “Aha! Aha!”
> be driven back and disgraced!
> <cite>70:4</cite> May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you!
> May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually,

> O God, hurry to me!
> You are my helper and my deliverer!
> O Lord, do not delay!

### Psalm 71

> <cite>71:1</cite> In you, O Lord, I have taken shelter!
> Never let me be humiliated!
> <cite>71:2</cite> Vindicate me by rescuing me!
> Listen to me! Deliver me!
> <cite>71:3</cite> Be my protector and refuge,
> a stronghold where I can be safe!
> For you are my high ridge and my stronghold.
> <cite>71:4</cite> My God, rescue me from the power of the wicked,
> from the hand of the cruel oppressor!
> <cite>71:5</cite> For you give me confidence, O sovereign Master;
> O Lord, I have trusted in you since I was young.
> <cite>71:6</cite> I have leaned on you since birth;
> you pulled me from my mother’s womb.
> I praise you continually.
> <cite>71:7</cite> Many are appalled when they see me,
> but you are my secure shelter.
> <cite>71:8</cite> I praise you constantly
> and speak of your splendor all day long.
> <cite>71:9</cite> Do not reject me in my old age!
> When my strength fails, do not abandon me!
> <cite>71:10</cite> For my enemies talk about me;
> those waiting for a chance to kill me plot my demise.
> <cite>71:11</cite> They say, “God has abandoned him.
> Run and seize him, for there is no one who will rescue him!”
> <cite>71:12</cite> O God, do not remain far away from me!
> My God, hurry and help me!
> <cite>71:13</cite> May my accusers be humiliated and defeated!
> May those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace!
> <cite>71:14</cite> As for me, I will wait continually,
> and will continue to praise you.
> <cite>71:15</cite> I will tell about your justice,
> and all day long proclaim your salvation,
> though I cannot fathom its full extent.
> <cite>71:16</cite> I will come and tell about the mighty acts of the sovereign Lord.
> I will proclaim your justice—yours alone.
> <cite>71:17</cite> O God, you have taught me since I was young,
> and I am still declaring your amazing deeds.
> <cite>71:18</cite> Even when I am old and gray,
> O God, do not abandon me,
> until I tell the next generation about your strength,
> and those coming after me about your power.
> <cite>71:19</cite> Your justice, O God, extends to the skies above;

> O God, who can compare to you?
> <cite>71:20</cite> Though you have allowed me to experience much trouble and distress,

> Bring me up once again from the depths of the earth!
> <cite>71:21</cite> Raise me to a position of great honor!

### Psalm 72

For Solomon.

> Grant the king’s son the ability to make fair decisions!
> <cite>72:2</cite> Then he will judge your people fairly,
> and your oppressed ones equitably.
> <cite>72:3</cite> The mountains will bring news of peace to the people,

> <cite>72:10</cite> The kings of Tarshish and the coastlands will offer gifts;
> the kings of Sheba and Seba will bring tribute.
> <cite>72:11</cite> All kings will bow down to him;

## Book 3 (73–89)

### Psalm 73

A psalm by Asaph.

> <cite>73:1</cite> Certainly God is good to Israel,
> and to those whose motives are pure!
> <cite>73:2</cite> But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
> my feet almost slid out from under me.
> <cite>73:3</cite> For I envied those who are proud,
> as I observed the prosperity of the wicked.
> <cite>73:4</cite> For they suffer no pain;
> their bodies are strong and well-fed.
> <cite>73:5</cite> They are immune to the trouble common to men;
> they do not suffer as other men do.
> <cite>73:6</cite> Arrogance is their necklace,
> and violence their clothing.
> <cite>73:7</cite> Their prosperity causes them to do wrong;
> their thoughts are sinful.
> <cite>73:8</cite> They mock and say evil things;
> they proudly threaten violence.
> <cite>73:9</cite> They speak as if they rule in heaven,
> and lay claim to the earth.
> <cite>73:10</cite> Therefore they have more than enough food to eat,
> and even suck up the water of the sea.
> <cite>73:11</cite> They say, “How does God know what we do?
> Is the sovereign one aware of what goes on?”
> <cite>73:12</cite> Take a good look! This is what the wicked are like,
> those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer.
> <cite>73:13</cite> I concluded, “Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure
> and maintained a pure lifestyle.
> <cite>73:14</cite> I suffer all day long,
> and am punished every morning.”
> <cite>73:15</cite> If I had publicized these thoughts,
> I would have betrayed your loyal followers.
> <cite>73:16</cite> When I tried to make sense of this,
> it was troubling to me.
> <cite>73:17</cite> Then I entered the precincts of God’s temple,
> and understood the destiny of the wicked.
> <cite>73:18</cite> Surely you put them in slippery places;
> you bring them down to ruin.
> <cite>73:19</cite> How desolate they become in a mere moment!
> Terrifying judgments make their demise complete!
> <cite>73:20</cite> They are like a dream after one wakes up.
> O sovereign Master, when you awake you will despise them.
> <cite>73:21</cite> Yes, my spirit was bitter,
> and my insides felt sharp pain.
> <cite>73:22</cite> I was ignorant and lacked insight;
> I was as senseless as an animal before you.
> <cite>73:23</cite> But I am continually with you;
> you hold my right hand.
> <cite>73:24</cite> You guide me by your wise advice,
> and then you will lead me to a position of honor.
> <cite>73:25</cite> Whom do I have in heaven but you?
> I desire no one but you on earth.
> <cite>73:26</cite> My flesh and my heart may grow weak,
> but God always protects my heart and gives me stability.
> <cite>73:27</cite> Yes, look! Those far from you die;
> you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.
> <cite>73:28</cite> But as for me, God’s presence is all I need.
> I have made the sovereign Lord my shelter,
> as I declare all the things you have done.

### Psalm 74

A well-written song by Asaph.

> <cite>74:1</cite> Why, O God, have you permanently rejected us?
> Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
> <cite>74:2</cite> Remember your people whom you acquired in ancient times,
> whom you rescued so they could be your very own nation,
> as well as Mount Zion, where you dwell!
> <cite>74:3</cite> Hurry and look at the permanent ruins,
> and all the damage the enemy has done to the temple!
> <cite>74:4</cite> Your enemies roar in the middle of your sanctuary;
> they set up their battle flags.
> <cite>74:5</cite> They invade like lumberjacks
> swinging their axes in a thick forest.
> <cite>74:6</cite> And now they are tearing down all its engravings
> with axes and crowbars.
> <cite>74:7</cite> They set your sanctuary on fire;
> they desecrate your dwelling place by knocking it to the ground.
> <cite>74:8</cite> They say to themselves,
> “We will oppress all of them.”
> They burn down all the places where people worship God in the land.
> <cite>74:9</cite> We do not see any signs of God’s presence;
> there are no longer any prophets
> and we have no one to tell us how long this will last.
> <cite>74:10</cite> How long, O God, will the adversary hurl insults?
> Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
> <cite>74:11</cite> Why do you remain inactive?
> Intervene and destroy him!
> <cite>74:12</cite> But God has been my king from ancient times,
> performing acts of deliverance on the earth.
> <cite>74:13</cite> You destroyed the sea by your strength;
> you shattered the heads of the sea monster in the water.
> <cite>74:14</cite> You crushed the heads of Leviathan;
> you fed him to the people who live along the coast.
> <cite>74:15</cite> You broke open the spring and the stream;
> you dried up perpetually flowing rivers.
> <cite>74:16</cite> You established the cycle of day and night;
> you put the moon and sun in place.
> <cite>74:17</cite> You set up all the boundaries of the earth;
> you created the cycle of summer and winter.
> <cite>74:18</cite> Remember how the enemy hurls insults, O Lord,
> and how a foolish nation blasphemes your name!
> <cite>74:19</cite> Do not hand the life of your dove over to a wild animal!
> Do not continue to disregard the lives of your oppressed people!
> <cite>74:20</cite> Remember your covenant promises,
> for the dark regions of the earth are full of places where violence rules.
> <cite>74:21</cite> Do not let the afflicted be turned back in shame!
> Let the oppressed and poor praise your name!
> <cite>74:22</cite> Rise up, O God! Defend your honor!
> Remember how fools insult you all day long!
> <cite>74:23</cite> Do not disregard what your enemies say,
> or the unceasing shouts of those who defy you.

### Psalm 75

For the music director; according to the al-tashcheth style; a psalm of Asaph; a song.

> <cite>75:1</cite> We give thanks to you, O God! We give thanks!
> You reveal your presence;
> people tell about your amazing deeds.
> <cite>75:2</cite> God says,
> “At the appointed times,
> I judge fairly.
> <cite>75:3</cite> When the earth and all its inhabitants dissolve in fear,
> I make its pillars secure.” (Selah)
> <cite>75:4</cite> I say to the proud, “Do not be proud,”
> and to the wicked, “Do not be so confident of victory!
> <cite>75:5</cite> Do not be so certain you have won!
> Do not speak with your head held so high!
> <cite>75:6</cite> For victory does not come from the east or west,
> or from the wilderness.
> <cite>75:7</cite> For God is the judge!
> He brings one down and exalts another.
> <cite>75:8</cite> For the Lord holds in his hand a cup full
> of foaming wine mixed with spices,
> and pours it out.
> Surely all the wicked of the earth
> will slurp it up and drink it to its very last drop.”
> <cite>75:9</cite> As for me, I will continually tell what you have done;
> I will sing praises to the God of Jacob!
> <cite>75:10</cite> God says,
> “I will bring down all the power of the wicked;
> the godly will be victorious.”

### Psalm 76

For the music director; to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of Asaph, a song.

> <cite>76:1</cite> God has revealed himself in Judah;
> in Israel his reputation is great.
> <cite>76:2</cite> He lives in Salem;
> he dwells in Zion.
> <cite>76:3</cite> There he shattered the arrows,
> the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah)
> <cite>76:4</cite> You shine brightly and reveal your majesty,
> as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey.
> <cite>76:5</cite> The bravehearted were plundered;
> they “fell asleep.”
> All the warriors were helpless.
> <cite>76:6</cite> At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob,
> both rider and horse “fell asleep.”
> <cite>76:7</cite> You are awesome! Yes, you!
> Who can withstand your intense anger?
> <cite>76:8</cite> From heaven you announced what their punishment would be.
> The earth was afraid and silent
> <cite>76:9</cite> when God arose to execute judgment,
> and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
> <cite>76:10</cite> Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise;
> you reveal your anger in full measure.
> <cite>76:11</cite> Make vows to the Lord your God and repay them!
> Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one!
> <cite>76:12</cite> He humbles princes;
> the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.

### Psalm 77

For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of Asaph.

> <cite>77:1</cite> I will cry out to God and call for help!
> I will cry out to God and he will pay attention to me.
> <cite>77:2</cite> In my time of trouble I sought the sovereign Master.
> I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night.
> I refused to be comforted.
> <cite>77:3</cite> I said, “I will remember God while I groan;
> I will think about him while my strength leaves me.” (Selah)
> <cite>77:4</cite> You held my eyelids open;
> I was troubled and could not speak.
> <cite>77:5</cite> I thought about the days of old,
> about ancient times.
> <cite>77:6</cite> I said, “During the night I will remember the song I once sang;
> I will think very carefully.”
> I tried to make sense of what was happening.
> <cite>77:7</cite> I asked, “Will the sovereign Master reject me forever?
> Will he never again show me his favor?
> <cite>77:8</cite> Has his loyal love disappeared forever?
> Has his promise failed forever?
> <cite>77:9</cite> Has God forgotten to be merciful?
> Has his anger stifled his compassion?”
> <cite>77:10</cite> Then I said, “I am sickened by the thought
> that the Sovereign One might become inactive.
> <cite>77:11</cite> I will remember the works of the Lord.
> Yes, I will remember the amazing things you did long ago!
> <cite>77:12</cite> I will think about all you have done;
> I will reflect upon your deeds!”
> <cite>77:13</cite> O God, your deeds are extraordinary!
> What god can compare to our great God?
> <cite>77:14</cite> You are the God who does amazing things;
> you have revealed your strength among the nations.
> <cite>77:15</cite> You delivered your people by your strength—
> the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)
> <cite>77:16</cite> The waters saw you, O God,
> the waters saw you and trembled.
> Yes, the depths of the sea shook with fear.
> <cite>77:17</cite> The clouds poured down rain;
> the skies thundered.
> Yes, your arrows flashed about.
> <cite>77:18</cite> Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind;
> the lightning bolts lit up the world;
> the earth trembled and shook.
> <cite>77:19</cite> You walked through the sea;
> you passed through the surging waters,
> but left no footprints.
> <cite>77:20</cite> You led your people like a flock of sheep,
> by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

### Psalm 78

A well-written song by Asaph.

> <cite>78:1</cite> Pay attention, my people, to my instruction!
> Listen to the words I speak!
> <cite>78:2</cite> I will sing a song that imparts wisdom;
> I will make insightful observations about the past.
> <cite>78:3</cite> What we have heard and learned—
> that which our ancestors have told us—
> <cite>78:4</cite> we will not hide from their descendants.
> We will tell the next generation
> about the Lord’s praiseworthy acts,
> about his strength and the amazing things he has done.
> <cite>78:5</cite> He established a rule in Jacob;
> he set up a law in Israel.
> He commanded our ancestors
> to make his deeds known to their descendants,
> <cite>78:6</cite> so that the next generation, children yet to be born,
> might know about them.
> They will grow up and tell their descendants about them.
> <cite>78:7</cite> Then they will place their confidence in God.
> They will not forget the works of God,
> and they will obey his commands.
> <cite>78:8</cite> Then they will not be like their ancestors,
> who were a stubborn and rebellious generation,
> a generation that was not committed
> and faithful to God.
> <cite>78:9</cite> The Ephraimites were armed with bows,
> but they retreated in the day of battle.
> <cite>78:10</cite> They did not keep their covenant with God,
> and they refused to obey his law.
> <cite>78:11</cite> They forgot what he had done,
> the amazing things he had shown them.
> <cite>78:12</cite> He did amazing things in the sight of their ancestors,
> in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
> <cite>78:13</cite> He divided the sea and led them across it;
> he made the water stand in a heap.
> <cite>78:14</cite> He led them with a cloud by day,
> and with the light of a fire all night long.
> <cite>78:15</cite> He broke open rocks in the wilderness,
> and gave them enough water to fill the depths of the sea.
> <cite>78:16</cite> He caused streams to flow from the rock,
> and made the water flow like rivers.
> <cite>78:17</cite> Yet they continued to sin against him,
> and rebelled against the Sovereign One in the desert.
> <cite>78:18</cite> They willfully challenged God
> by asking for food to satisfy their appetite.
> <cite>78:19</cite> They insulted God, saying,
> “Is God really able to give us food in the wilderness?
> <cite>78:20</cite> Yes, he struck a rock and water flowed out,
> streams gushed forth.
> But can he also give us food?
> Will he provide meat for his people?”
> <cite>78:21</cite> When the Lord heard this, he was furious.
> A fire broke out against Jacob,
> and his anger flared up against Israel,
> <cite>78:22</cite> because they did not have faith in God,
> and did not trust his ability to deliver them.
> <cite>78:23</cite> He gave a command to the clouds above,
> and opened the doors in the sky.
> <cite>78:24</cite> He rained down manna for them to eat;
> he gave them the grain of heaven.
> <cite>78:25</cite> Man ate the food of the mighty ones.
> He sent them more than enough to eat.
> <cite>78:26</cite> He brought the east wind through the sky,
> and by his strength led forth the south wind.
> <cite>78:27</cite> He rained down meat on them like dust,
> birds as numerous as the sand on the seashores.
> <cite>78:28</cite> He caused them to fall right in the middle of their camp,
> all around their homes.
> <cite>78:29</cite> They ate until they were stuffed;
> he gave them what they desired.
> <cite>78:30</cite> They were not yet filled up,
> their food was still in their mouths,
> <cite>78:31</cite> when the anger of God flared up against them.
> He killed some of the strongest of them;
> he brought the young men of Israel to their knees.
> <cite>78:32</cite> Despite all this, they continued to sin,
> and did not trust him to do amazing things.
> <cite>78:33</cite> So he caused them to die unsatisfied
> and filled with terror.
> <cite>78:34</cite> When he struck them down, they sought his favor;
> they turned back and longed for God.
> <cite>78:35</cite> They remembered that God was their protector,
> and that the sovereign God was their deliverer.
> <cite>78:36</cite> But they deceived him with their words,
> and lied to him.
> <cite>78:37</cite> They were not really committed to him,

> <cite>78:39</cite> He remembered that they were made of flesh,

> <cite>78:40</cite> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,

> <cite>78:41</cite> They again challenged God,

> <cite>78:50</cite> He sent his anger in full force;

> <cite>78:51</cite> He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt,

> <cite>78:52</cite> Yet he brought out his people like sheep;

> <cite>78:53</cite> He guided them safely along,
> while the sea covered their enemies.
> <cite>78:54</cite> He brought them to the border of his holy land,

> <cite>78:55</cite> He drove the nations out from before them;

> and allowed the tribes of Israel to settle down.
> <cite>78:56</cite> Yet they challenged and defied the Sovereign God,
> and did not obey his commands.
> <cite>78:57</cite> They were unfaithful and acted as treacherously as their ancestors;
> they were as unreliable as a malfunctioning bow.
> <cite>78:58</cite> They made him angry with their pagan shrines,
> and made him jealous with their idols.
> <cite>78:59</cite> God heard and was angry;

> <cite>78:60</cite> He abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh,
> the tent where he lived among men.
> <cite>78:61</cite> He allowed the symbol of his strong presence to be captured;

> <cite>78:63</cite> Fire consumed their young men,

> <cite>78:64</cite> Their priests fell by the sword,
> but their widows did not weep.
> <cite>78:65</cite> But then the sovereign Master awoke from his sleep;
> he was like a warrior in a drunken rage.
> <cite>78:66</cite> He drove his enemies back;
> he made them a permanent target for insults.
> <cite>78:67</cite> He rejected the tent of Joseph;
> he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
> <cite>78:68</cite> He chose the tribe of Judah,
> and Mount Zion, which he loves.
> <cite>78:69</cite> He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens above;
> as secure as the earth, which he established permanently.
> <cite>78:70</cite> He chose David, his servant,
> and took him from the sheepfolds.
> <cite>78:71</cite> He took him away from following the mother sheep,
> and made him the shepherd of Jacob, his people,
> and of Israel, his chosen nation.
> <cite>78:72</cite> David cared for them with pure motives;
> he led them with skill.

## Book 4 (Psalm 90–106)

### Psalm 90

A prayer of Moses, the man of God.

> <cite>90:1</cite> O sovereign Master, you have been our protector through all generations!
> <cite>90:2</cite> Even before the mountains came into existence,
> or you brought the world into being,
> you were the eternal God.
> <cite>90:3</cite> You make mankind return to the dust,
> and say, “Return, O people!”
> <cite>90:4</cite> Yes, in your eyes a thousand years
> are like yesterday that quickly passes,
> or like one of the divisions of the nighttime.
> <cite>90:5</cite> You bring their lives to an end and they “fall asleep.”
> In the morning they are like the grass that sprouts up;
> <cite>90:6</cite> in the morning it glistens and sprouts up;
> at evening time it withers and dries up.
> <cite>90:7</cite> Yes, we are consumed by your anger;
> we are terrified by your wrath.
> <cite>90:8</cite> You are aware of our sins;
> you even know about our hidden sins.
> <cite>90:9</cite> Yes, throughout all our days we experience your raging fury;
> the years of our lives pass quickly, like a sigh.
> <cite>90:10</cite> The days of our lives add up to seventy years,
> or eighty, if one is especially strong.
> But even one’s best years are marred by trouble and oppression.
> Yes, they pass quickly and we fly away.
> <cite>90:11</cite> Who can really fathom the intensity of your anger?
> Your raging fury causes people to fear you.
> <cite>90:12</cite> So teach us to consider our mortality,
> so that we might live wisely.
> <cite>90:13</cite> Turn back toward us, O Lord!
> How long must this suffering last?
> Have pity on your servants!
> <cite>90:14</cite> Satisfy us in the morning with your loyal love!
> Then we will shout for joy and be happy all our days!
> <cite>90:15</cite> Make us happy in proportion to the days you have afflicted us,
> in proportion to the years we have experienced trouble!
> <cite>90:16</cite> May your servants see your work!
> May their sons see your majesty!
> <cite>90:17</cite> May our sovereign God extend his favor to us!
> Make our endeavors successful!
> Yes, make them successful!

### Psalm 91

> <cite>91:1</cite> As for you, the one who lives in the shelter of the Sovereign One,
> and resides in the protective shadow of the mighty king—
> <cite>91:2</cite> I say this about the Lord, my shelter and my stronghold,
> my God in whom I trust—
> <cite>91:3</cite> he will certainly rescue you from the snare of the hunter
> and from the destructive plague.
> <cite>91:4</cite> He will shelter you with his wings;
> you will find safety under his wings.
> His faithfulness is like a shield or a protective wall.
> <cite>91:5</cite> You need not fear the terrors of the night,
> the arrow that flies by day,
> <cite>91:6</cite> the plague that comes in the darkness,
> or the disease that comes at noon.
> <cite>91:7</cite> Though a thousand may fall beside you,
> and a multitude on your right side,
> it will not reach you.
> <cite>91:8</cite> Certainly you will see it with your very own eyes—
> you will see the wicked paid back.
> <cite>91:9</cite> For you have taken refuge in the Lord,
> my shelter, the Sovereign One.
> <cite>91:10</cite> No harm will overtake you;
> no illness will come near your home.
> <cite>91:11</cite> For he will order his angels
> to protect you in all you do.
> <cite>91:12</cite> They will lift you up in their hands,
> so you will not slip and fall on a stone.
> <cite>91:13</cite> You will subdue a lion and a snake;
> you will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent.
> <cite>91:14</cite> The Lord says,
> “Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him;
> I will protect him because he is loyal to me.
> <cite>91:15</cite> When he calls out to me, I will answer him.
> I will be with him when he is in trouble;
> I will rescue him and bring him honor.
> <cite>91:16</cite> I will satisfy him with long life,
> and will let him see my salvation.

### Psalm 92

A psalm; a song for the Sabbath day.

> <cite>92:1</cite> It is fitting to thank the Lord,
> and to sing praises to your name, O Sovereign One!
> <cite>92:2</cite> It is fitting to proclaim your loyal love in the morning,
> and your faithfulness during the night,
> <cite>92:3</cite> to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument and a lyre,
> to the accompaniment of the meditative tone of the harp.
> <cite>92:4</cite> For you, O Lord, have made me happy by your work.
> I will sing for joy because of what you have done.
> <cite>92:5</cite> How great are your works, O Lord!
> Your plans are very intricate!
> <cite>92:6</cite> The spiritually insensitive do not recognize this;
> the fool does not understand this.
> <cite>92:7</cite> When the wicked sprout up like grass,
> and all the evildoers glisten,
> it is so that they may be annihilated.
> <cite>92:8</cite> But you, O Lord, reign forever!
> <cite>92:9</cite> Indeed, look at your enemies, O Lord!
> Indeed, look at how your enemies perish!
> All the evildoers are scattered!
> <cite>92:10</cite> You exalt my horn like that of a wild ox.
> I am covered with fresh oil.
> <cite>92:11</cite> I gloat in triumph over those who tried to ambush me;
> I hear the defeated cries of the evil foes who attacked me.
> <cite>92:12</cite> The godly grow like a palm tree;
> they grow high like a cedar in Lebanon.
> <cite>92:13</cite> Planted in the Lord’s house,
> they grow in the courts of our God.
> <cite>92:14</cite> They bear fruit even when they are old;
> they are filled with vitality and have many leaves.
> <cite>92:15</cite> So they proclaim that the Lord, my protector,
> is just and never unfair.

> <cite>93:2</cite> Your throne has been secure from ancient times;
> you have always been king.
> <cite>93:3</cite> The waves roar, O Lord,
> the waves roar,
> the waves roar and crash.
> <cite>93:4</cite> Above the sound of the surging water,
> and the mighty waves of the sea,
> the Lord sits enthroned in majesty.
> <cite>93:5</cite> The rules you set down are completely reliable.
> Holiness aptly adorns your house, O Lord, forever.

### Psalm 94

> O God who avenges, reveal your splendor!
> <cite>94:2</cite> Rise up, O judge of the earth!
> Pay back the proud!
> <cite>94:3</cite> O Lord, how long will the wicked,
> how long will the wicked celebrate?
> <cite>94:4</cite> They spew out threats and speak defiantly;
> all the evildoers boast.
> <cite>94:5</cite> O Lord, they crush your people;
> they oppress the nation that belongs to you.
> <cite>94:6</cite> They kill the widow and the one residing outside his native land,
> and they murder the fatherless.
> <cite>94:7</cite> Then they say, “The Lord does not see this;
> the God of Jacob does not take notice of it.”
> <cite>94:8</cite> Take notice of this, you ignorant people!
> You fools, when will you ever understand?
> <cite>94:9</cite> Does the one who makes the human ear not hear?
> Does the one who forms the human eye not see?
> <cite>94:10</cite> Does the one who disciplines the nations not punish?
> He is the one who imparts knowledge to human beings!
> <cite>94:11</cite> The Lord knows that
> peoples’ thoughts are morally bankrupt.
> <cite>94:12</cite> How happy is the one whom you instruct, O Lord,
> the one whom you teach from your law,
> <cite>94:13</cite> in order to protect him from times of trouble,
> until the wicked are destroyed.
> <cite>94:14</cite> Certainly the Lord does not forsake his people;
> he does not abandon the nation that belongs to him.
> <cite>94:15</cite> For justice will prevail,
> and all the morally upright will be vindicated.
> <cite>94:16</cite> Who will rise up to defend me against the wicked?
> Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?
> <cite>94:17</cite> If the Lord had not helped me,
> I would have laid down in the silence of death.
> <cite>94:18</cite> If I say, “My foot is slipping,”
> your loyal love, O Lord, supports me.
> <cite>94:19</cite> When worries threaten to overwhelm me,
> your soothing touch makes me happy.
> <cite>94:20</cite> Cruel rulers are not your allies,
> those who make oppressive laws.
> <cite>94:21</cite> They conspire against the blameless,
> and condemn to death the innocent.
> <cite>94:22</cite> But the Lord will protect me,
> and my God will shelter me.
> <cite>94:23</cite> He will pay them back for their sin.
> He will destroy them because of their evil;
> the Lord our God will destroy them.

> like they were that day at Massah in the wilderness,
> <cite>95:9</cite> where your ancestors challenged my authority,
> and tried my patience, even though they had seen my work.
> <cite>95:10</cite> For forty years I was continually disgusted with that generation,
> and I said, ‘These people desire to go astray;
> they do not obey my commands.’

> When I call out to you, quickly answer me!
> <cite>102:3</cite> For my days go up in smoke,
> and my bones are charred like a fireplace.
> <cite>102:4</cite> My heart is parched and withered like grass,
> for I am unable to eat food.
> <cite>102:5</cite> Because of the anxiety that makes me groan,
> my bones protrude from my skin.
> <cite>102:6</cite> I am like an owl in the wilderness;
> I am like a screech owl among the ruins.
> <cite>102:7</cite> I stay awake;
> I am like a solitary bird on a roof.
> <cite>102:8</cite> All day long my enemies taunt me;
> those who mock me use my name in their curses.
> <cite>102:9</cite> For I eat ashes as if they were bread,
> and mix my drink with my tears,
> <cite>102:10</cite> because of your anger and raging fury.

> <cite>102:17</cite> when he responds to the prayer of the destitute,
> and does not reject their request.
> <cite>102:18</cite> The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations;
> people yet to be born will praise the Lord.
> <cite>102:19</cite> For he will look down from his sanctuary above;
> from heaven the Lord will look toward earth,
> <cite>102:20</cite> in order to hear the painful cries of the prisoners,
> and to set free those condemned to die,
> <cite>102:21</cite> so they may proclaim the name of the Lord in Zion,
> and praise him in Jerusalem,
> <cite>102:22</cite> when the nations gather together,
> and the kingdoms pay tribute to the Lord.
> <cite>102:23</cite> He has taken away my strength in the middle of life;
> he has cut short my days.
> <cite>102:24</cite> I say, “O my God, please do not take me away in the middle of my life!

> <cite>102:26</cite> They will perish,
> but you will endure.
> They will wear out like a garment;
> like clothes you will remove them and they will disappear.
> <cite>102:27</cite> But you remain;
> your years do not come to an end.
> <cite>102:28</cite> The children of your servants will settle down here,

> <cite>103:8</cite> The Lord is compassionate and merciful;
> he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love.
> <cite>103:9</cite> He does not always accuse,
> and does not stay angry.
> <cite>103:10</cite> He does not deal with us as our sins deserve;
> he does not repay us as our misdeeds deserve.
> <cite>103:11</cite> For as the skies are high above the earth,
> so his loyal love towers over his faithful followers.
> <cite>103:12</cite> As far as the eastern horizon is from the west,
> so he removes the guilt of our rebellious actions from us.
> <cite>103:13</cite> As a father has compassion on his children,
> so the Lord has compassion on his faithful followers.
> <cite>103:14</cite> For he knows what we are made of;

> <cite>103:15</cite> A person’s life is like grass.
> Like a flower in the field it flourishes,
> <cite>103:16</cite> but when the hot wind blows by, it disappears,

### Psalm 104

> <cite>104:1</cite> Praise the Lord, O my soul!
> O Lord my God, you are magnificent.
> You are robed in splendor and majesty.
> <cite>104:2</cite> He covers himself with light as if it were a garment.
> He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain,
> <cite>104:3</cite> and lays the beams of the upper rooms of his palace on the rain clouds.
> He makes the clouds his chariot,
> and travels along on the wings of the wind.
> <cite>104:4</cite> He makes the winds his messengers,
> and the flaming fire his attendant.
> <cite>104:5</cite> He established the earth on its foundations;
> it will never be upended.
> <cite>104:6</cite> The watery deep covered it like a garment;
> the waters reached above the mountains.
> <cite>104:7</cite> Your shout made the waters retreat;
> at the sound of your thunderous voice they hurried off—
> <cite>104:8</cite> as the mountains rose up,
> and the valleys went down—
> to the place you appointed for them.
> <cite>104:9</cite> You set up a boundary for them that they could not cross,
> so that they would not cover the earth again.
> <cite>104:10</cite> He turns springs into streams;
> they flow between the mountains.
> <cite>104:11</cite> They provide water for all the animals in the field;
> the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
> <cite>104:12</cite> The birds of the sky live beside them;
> they chirp among the bushes.
> <cite>104:13</cite> He waters the mountains from the upper rooms of his palace;
> the earth is full of the fruit you cause to grow.
> <cite>104:14</cite> He provides grass for the cattle,
> and crops for people to cultivate,
> so they can produce food from the ground,
> <cite>104:15</cite> as well as wine that makes people feel so good,
> and so they can have oil to make their faces shine,
> as well as food that sustains people’s lives.
> <cite>104:16</cite> The trees of the Lord receive all the rain they need,
> the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,
> <cite>104:17</cite> where the birds make nests,
> near the evergreens in which the herons live.
> <cite>104:18</cite> The wild goats live in the high mountains;
> the rock badgers find safety in the cliffs.
> <cite>104:19</cite> He made the moon to mark the months,
> and the sun sets according to a regular schedule.
> <cite>104:20</cite> You make it dark and night comes,
> during which all the beasts of the forest prowl around.
> <cite>104:21</cite> The lions roar for prey,
> seeking their food from God.
> <cite>104:22</cite> When the sun rises, they withdraw
> and sleep in their dens.
> <cite>104:23</cite> Men then go out to do their work,
> and labor away until evening.
> <cite>104:24</cite> How many living things you have made, O Lord!
> You have exhibited great skill in making all of them;
> the earth is full of the living things you have made.
> <cite>104:25</cite> Over here is the deep, wide sea,
> which teems with innumerable swimming creatures,
> living things both small and large.
> <cite>104:26</cite> The ships travel there,
> and over here swims the whale you made to play in it.
> <cite>104:27</cite> All of your creatures wait for you
> to provide them with food on a regular basis.
> <cite>104:28</cite> You give food to them and they receive it;
> you open your hand and they are filled with food.
> <cite>104:29</cite> When you ignore them, they panic.
> When you take away their life’s breath, they die
> and return to dust.
> <cite>104:30</cite> When you send your life-giving breath, they are created,
> and you replenish the surface of the ground.
> <cite>104:31</cite> May the splendor of the Lord endure!
> May the Lord find pleasure in the living things he has made!
> <cite>104:32</cite> He looks down on the earth and it shakes;
> he touches the mountains and they start to smolder.
> <cite>104:33</cite> I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;
> I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist!
> <cite>104:34</cite> May my thoughts be pleasing to him!
> I will rejoice in the Lord.
> <cite>104:35</cite> May sinners disappear from the earth,
> and the wicked vanish!
> Praise the Lord, O my soul!
> Praise the Lord!

### Psalm 105

> <cite>105:1</cite> Give thanks to the Lord!
> Call on his name!
> Make known his accomplishments among the nations!
> <cite>105:2</cite> Sing to him!
> Make music to him!
> Reflect on all his miraculous deeds!
> <cite>105:3</cite> Boast about his holy name!
> Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice!
> <cite>105:4</cite> Seek the Lord and the strength he gives!
> Seek his presence continually!
> <cite>105:5</cite> Recall the miraculous deeds he performed,
> his mighty acts and the judgments he decreed,
> <cite>105:6</cite> O children of Abraham, his servant,
> you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones!
> <cite>105:7</cite> He is the Lord our God;
> he carries out judgment throughout the earth.
> <cite>105:8</cite> He always remembers his covenantal decree,
> the promise he made to a thousand generations—
> <cite>105:9</cite> the one he made to Abraham,
> the promise he made by oath to Isaac!
> <cite>105:10</cite> He gave it to Jacob as a decree,
> to Israel as a lasting promise,
> <cite>105:11</cite> saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
> as the portion of your inheritance.”
> <cite>105:12</cite> When they were few in number,
> just a very few, and resident aliens within it,
> <cite>105:13</cite> they wandered from nation to nation,
> and from one kingdom to another.
> <cite>105:14</cite> He let no one oppress them;
> he disciplined kings for their sake,
> <cite>105:15</cite> saying,“Don’t touch my chosen ones!
> Don’t harm my prophets!”
> <cite>105:16</cite> He called down a famine upon the earth;
> he cut off all the food supply.
> <cite>105:17</cite> He sent a man ahead of them—
> Joseph was sold as a servant.
> <cite>105:18</cite> The shackles hurt his feet;
> his neck was placed in an iron collar,
> <cite>105:19</cite> until the time when his prediction came true.
> The Lord’s word proved him right.
> <cite>105:20</cite> The king authorized his release;
> the ruler of nations set him free.
> <cite>105:21</cite> He put him in charge of his palace,
> and made him manager of all his property,
> <cite>105:22</cite> giving him authority to imprison his officials
> and to teach his advisers.
> <cite>105:23</cite> Israel moved to Egypt;
> Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.
> <cite>105:24</cite> The Lord made his people very fruitful,
> and made them more numerous than their enemies.
> <cite>105:25</cite> He caused them to hate his people,
> and to mistreat his servants.
> <cite>105:26</cite> He sent his servant Moses,
> and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
> <cite>105:27</cite> They executed his miraculous signs among them,
> and his amazing deeds in the land of Ham.
> <cite>105:28</cite> He made it dark;
> they did not disobey his orders.
> <cite>105:29</cite> He turned their water into blood,
> and killed their fish.
> <cite>105:30</cite> Their land was overrun by frogs,
> which even got into the rooms of their kings.
> <cite>105:31</cite> He ordered flies to come;
> gnats invaded their whole territory.
> <cite>105:32</cite> He sent hail along with the rain;
> there was lightning in their land.
> <cite>105:33</cite> He destroyed their vines and fig trees,
> and broke the trees throughout their territory.
> <cite>105:34</cite> He ordered locusts to come,
> innumerable grasshoppers.
> <cite>105:35</cite> They ate all the vegetation in their land,
> and devoured the crops of their fields.
> <cite>105:36</cite> He struck down all the firstborn in their land,
> the firstfruits of their reproductive power.
> <cite>105:37</cite> He brought his people out enriched with silver and gold;
> none of his tribes stumbled.
> <cite>105:38</cite> Egypt was happy when they left,
> for they were afraid of them.
> <cite>105:39</cite> He spread out a cloud for a cover,
> and provided a fire to light up the night.
> <cite>105:40</cite> They asked for food, and he sent quails;
> he satisfied them with food from the sky.
> <cite>105:41</cite> He opened up a rock and water flowed out;
> a river ran through dry regions.
> <cite>105:42</cite> Yes, he remembered the sacred promise
> he made to Abraham his servant.
> <cite>105:43</cite> When he led his people out, they rejoiced;
> his chosen ones shouted with joy.
> <cite>105:44</cite> He handed the territory of nations over to them,
> and they took possession of what other peoples had produced,
> <cite>105:45</cite> so that they might keep his commands
> and obey his laws.
> Praise the Lord!

### Psalm 106

> <cite>106:1</cite> Praise the Lord!
> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,
> and his loyal love endures!
> <cite>106:2</cite> Who can adequately recount the Lord’s mighty acts,
> or relate all his praiseworthy deeds?
> <cite>106:3</cite> How happy are those who promote justice,
> and do what is right all the time!
> <cite>106:4</cite> Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people!
> Pay attention to me, when you deliver,
> <cite>106:5</cite> so I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones,
> rejoice along with your nation,
> and boast along with the people who belong to you.
> <cite>106:6</cite> We have sinned like our ancestors;
> we have done wrong, we have done evil.
> <cite>106:7</cite> Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds,
> they failed to remember your many acts of loyal love,
> and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.
> <cite>106:8</cite> Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation,
> that he might reveal his power.
> <cite>106:9</cite> He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up;
> he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert.
> <cite>106:10</cite> He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them,
> and rescued them from the power of the enemy.
> <cite>106:11</cite> The water covered their enemies;
> not even one of them survived.
> <cite>106:12</cite> They believed his promises;
> they sang praises to him.
> <cite>106:13</cite> They quickly forgot what he had done;
> they did not wait for his instructions.
> <cite>106:14</cite> In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat;
> they challenged God in the desert.
> <cite>106:15</cite> He granted their request,
> then struck them with a disease.
> <cite>106:16</cite> In the camp they resented Moses,
> and Aaron, the Lord’s holy priest.
> <cite>106:17</cite> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;
> it engulfed the group led by Abiram.
> <cite>106:18</cite> Fire burned their group;
> the flames scorched the wicked.
> <cite>106:19</cite> They made an image of a calf at Horeb,
> and worshiped a metal idol.
> <cite>106:20</cite> They traded their majestic God
> for the image of an ox that eats grass.
> <cite>106:21</cite> They rejected the God who delivered them,
> the one who performed great deeds in Egypt,
> <cite>106:22</cite> amazing feats in the land of Ham,
> mighty acts by the Red Sea.
> <cite>106:23</cite> He threatened to destroy them,
> but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him
> and turned back his destructive anger.
> <cite>106:24</cite> They rejected the fruitful land;
> they did not believe his promise.
> <cite>106:25</cite> They grumbled in their tents;
> they did not obey the Lord.
> <cite>106:26</cite> So he made a solemn vow
> that he would make them die in the desert,
> <cite>106:27</cite> make their descendants die among the nations,
> and scatter them among foreign lands.
> <cite>106:28</cite> They worshiped Baal of Peor,
> and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
> <cite>106:29</cite> They made the Lord angry by their actions,
> and a plague broke out among them.
> <cite>106:30</cite> Phinehas took a stand and intervened,
> and the plague subsided.
> <cite>106:31</cite> This brought him a reward,
> an eternal gift.
> <cite>106:32</cite> They made him angry by the waters of Meribah,
> and Moses suffered because of them,
> <cite>106:33</cite> for they aroused his temper,
> and he spoke rashly.
> <cite>106:34</cite> They did not destroy the nations,
> as the Lord had commanded them to do.
> <cite>106:35</cite> They mixed in with the nations
> and learned their ways.
> <cite>106:36</cite> They worshiped their idols,
> which became a snare to them.
> <cite>106:37</cite> They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
> <cite>106:38</cite> They shed innocent blood—
> the blood of their sons and daughters,
> whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.
> The land was polluted by bloodshed.
> <cite>106:39</cite> They were defiled by their deeds,
> and unfaithful in their actions.
> <cite>106:40</cite> So the Lord was angry with his people
> and despised the people who belong to him.
> <cite>106:41</cite> He handed them over to the nations,
> and those who hated them ruled over them.
> <cite>106:42</cite> Their enemies oppressed them;
> they were subject to their authority.
> <cite>106:43</cite> Many times he delivered them,
> but they had a rebellious attitude,
> and degraded themselves by their sin.
> <cite>106:44</cite> Yet he took notice of their distress,
> when he heard their cry for help.
> <cite>106:45</cite> He remembered his covenant with them,
> and relented because of his great loyal love.
> <cite>106:46</cite> He caused all their conquerors
> to have pity on them.
> <cite>106:47</cite> Deliver us, O Lord, our God!
> Gather us from among the nations!
> Then we will give thanks to your holy name,
> and boast about your praiseworthy deeds.
> <cite>106:48</cite> The Lord God of Israel deserves praise,
> in the future and forevermore.
> Let all the people say, “We agree! Praise the Lord!”

## Book 5 (107–150)

### Psalm 107

> <cite>107:1</cite> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,
> and his loyal love endures!
> <cite>107:2</cite> Let those delivered by the Lord speak out,
> those whom he delivered from the power of the enemy,
> <cite>107:3</cite> and gathered from foreign lands,
> from east and west,
> from north and south.
> <cite>107:4</cite> They wandered through the wilderness on a desert road;
> they found no city in which to live.
> <cite>107:5</cite> They were hungry and thirsty;
> they fainted from exhaustion.
> <cite>107:6</cite> They cried out to the Lord in their distress;
> he delivered them from their troubles.
> <cite>107:7</cite> He led them on a level road,
> that they might find a city in which to live.
> <cite>107:8</cite> Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love,
> and for the amazing things he has done for people!
> <cite>107:9</cite> For he has satisfied those who thirst,
> and those who hunger he has filled with food.
> <cite>107:10</cite> They sat in utter darkness,
> bound in painful iron chains,
> <cite>107:11</cite> because they had rebelled against God’s commands,
> and rejected the instructions of the sovereign king.
> <cite>107:12</cite> So he used suffering to humble them;
> they stumbled and no one helped them up.
> <cite>107:13</cite> They cried out to the Lord in their distress;
> he delivered them from their troubles.
> <cite>107:14</cite> He brought them out of the utter darkness,
> and tore off their shackles.
> <cite>107:15</cite> Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love,
> and for the amazing things he has done for people!
> <cite>107:16</cite> For he shattered the bronze gates,
> and hacked through the iron bars.
> <cite>107:17</cite> They acted like fools in their rebellious ways,
> and suffered because of their sins.
> <cite>107:18</cite> They lost their appetite for all food,
> and they drew near the gates of death.
> <cite>107:19</cite> They cried out to the Lord in their distress;
> he delivered them from their troubles.
> <cite>107:20</cite> He sent them an assuring word and healed them;
> he rescued them from the pits where they were trapped.
> <cite>107:21</cite> Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love,
> and for the amazing things he has done for people!
> <cite>107:22</cite> Let them present thank offerings,
> and loudly proclaim what he has done!
> <cite>107:23</cite> Some traveled on the sea in ships,
> and carried cargo over the vast waters.
> <cite>107:24</cite> They witnessed the acts of the Lord,
> his amazing feats on the deep water.
> <cite>107:25</cite> He gave the order for a windstorm,
> and it stirred up the waves of the sea.
> <cite>107:26</cite> They reached up to the sky,
> then dropped into the depths.
> The sailors’ strength left them because the danger was so great.
> <cite>107:27</cite> They swayed and staggered like a drunk,
> and all their skill proved ineffective.
> <cite>107:28</cite> They cried out to the Lord in their distress;
> he delivered them from their troubles.
> <cite>107:29</cite> He calmed the storm,
> and the waves grew silent.
> <cite>107:30</cite> The sailors rejoiced because the waves grew quiet,
> and he led them to the harbor they desired.
> <cite>107:31</cite> Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love,
> and for the amazing things he has done for people!
> <cite>107:32</cite> Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people!
> Let them praise him in the place where the leaders preside!
> <cite>107:33</cite> He turned streams into a desert,
> springs of water into arid land,
> <cite>107:34</cite> and a fruitful land into a barren place,
> because of the sin of its inhabitants.
> <cite>107:35</cite> As for his people, he turned a desert into a pool of water,
> and a dry land into springs of water.
> <cite>107:36</cite> He allowed the hungry to settle there,
> and they established a city in which to live.
> <cite>107:37</cite> They cultivated fields,
> and planted vineyards,
> which yielded a harvest of fruit.
> <cite>107:38</cite> He blessed them so that they became very numerous.
> He would not allow their cattle to decrease in number.
> <cite>107:39</cite> As for their enemies, they decreased in number and were beaten down,
> because of painful distress and suffering.
> <cite>107:40</cite> He would pour contempt upon princes,
> and he made them wander in a wasteland with no road.
> <cite>107:41</cite> Yet he protected the needy from oppression,
> and cared for his families like a flock of sheep.
> <cite>107:42</cite> When the godly see this, they rejoice,
> and every sinner shuts his mouth.
> <cite>107:43</cite> Whoever is wise, let him take note of these things!
> Let them consider the Lord’s acts of loyal love!

### Psalm 108

A song, a psalm of David.

> <cite>108:1</cite> I am determined, O God!
> I will sing and praise you with my whole heart.
> <cite>108:2</cite> Awake, O stringed instrument and harp!
> I will wake up at dawn!
> <cite>108:3</cite> I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord!
> I will sing praises to you before foreigners!
> <cite>108:4</cite> For your loyal love extends beyond the sky,
> and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
> <cite>108:5</cite> Rise up above the sky, O God!
> May your splendor cover the whole earth!
> <cite>108:6</cite> Deliver by your power and answer me,
> so that the ones you love may be safe.
> <cite>108:7</cite> God has spoken in his sanctuary:
> “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem,
> the valley of Succoth I will measure off.
> <cite>108:8</cite> Gilead belongs to me,
> as does Manasseh!
> Ephraim is my helmet,
> Judah my royal scepter.
> <cite>108:9</cite> Moab is my wash basin.
> I will make Edom serve me.
> I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”
> <cite>108:10</cite> Who will lead me into the fortified city?
> Who will bring me to Edom?
> <cite>108:11</cite> Have you not rejected us, O God?
> O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.
> <cite>108:12</cite> Give us help against the enemy,
> for any help men might offer is futile.
> <cite>108:13</cite> By God’s power we will conquer;
> he will trample down our enemies.

### Psalm 109

For the music director, a psalm of David.

> <cite>109:1</cite> O God whom I praise, do not ignore me!
> <cite>109:2</cite> For they say cruel and deceptive things to me;
> they lie to me.
> <cite>109:3</cite> They surround me and say hateful things;
> they attack me for no reason.
> <cite>109:4</cite> They repay my love with accusations,
> but I continue to pray.
> <cite>109:5</cite> They repay me evil for good,
> and hate for love.
> <cite>109:6</cite> Appoint an evil man to testify against him!
> May an accuser stand at his right side!
> <cite>109:7</cite> When he is judged, he will be found guilty!
> Then his prayer will be regarded as sinful.
> <cite>109:8</cite> May his days be few!
> May another take his job!
> <cite>109:9</cite> May his children be fatherless,
> and his wife a widow!
> <cite>109:10</cite> May his children roam around begging,
> asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home!
> <cite>109:11</cite> May the creditor seize all he owns!
> May strangers loot his property!
> <cite>109:12</cite> May no one show him kindness!
> May no one have compassion on his fatherless children!
> <cite>109:13</cite> May his descendants be cut off!
> May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives!
> <cite>109:14</cite> May his ancestors’ sins be remembered by the Lord!
> May his mother’s sin not be forgotten!
> <cite>109:15</cite> May the Lord be constantly aware of them,
> and cut off the memory of his children from the earth!
> <cite>109:16</cite> For he never bothered to show kindness;
> he harassed the oppressed and needy,
> and killed the disheartened.
> <cite>109:17</cite> He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him.
> He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings.
> <cite>109:18</cite> He made cursing a way of life,
> so curses poured into his stomach like water
> and seeped into his bones like oil.
> <cite>109:19</cite> May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on,
> or a belt one wears continually!
> <cite>109:20</cite> May the Lord repay my accusers in this way,
> those who say evil things about me!
> <cite>109:21</cite> O sovereign Lord,
