He made it clear by sending his angel to his servant John, <a name="1:2">1:2</a> who then testified to everything that he saw concerning the word of God and the testimony about Jesus Christ. <a name="1:3">1:3</a> Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy aloud, and blessed are those who hear and obey the things written in it, because the time is near!</p> <p><a name="1:4">1:4</a> From John, to the seven churches that are in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from “he who is,” and who was, and who is still to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, <a name="1:5">1:5</a> and from Jesus Christ—the faithful witness, the firstborn from among the dead, the ruler over the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has set us free from our sins at the cost of his own blood <a name="1:6">1:6</a> and has appointed us as a kingdom, as priests serving his God and Father—to him be the glory and the power for ever and ever! Amen.</p> <blockquote> <p><a name="1:7">1:7</a> (Look! He is returning with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all the tribes on the earth will mourn because of him. This will certainly come to pass! Amen.)</p> </blockquote> <p><a name="1:8">1:8</a> “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God—the one who is, and who was, and who is still to come—the All-Powerful!</p> <p><a name="1:9">1:9</a> I, John, your brother and the one who shares with you in the persecution, kingdom, and endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus. <a name="1:10">1:10</a> I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day when I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, <a name="1:11">1:11</a> saying: “Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”</p> <p><a name="1:12">1:12</a> I turned to see whose voice was speaking to me, and when I did so, I saw seven golden lampstands, <a name="1:13">1:13</a> and in the midst of the lampstands was one like a son of man. He was dressed in a robe extending down to his feet and he wore a wide golden belt around his chest. <a name="1:14">1:14</a> His head and hair were as white as wool, even as white as snow, and his eyes were like a fiery flame. <a name="1:15">1:15</a> His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. <a name="1:16">1:16</a> He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp double-edged sword extended out of his mouth. His face shone like the sun shining at full strength. <a name="1:17">1:17</a> When I saw him I fell down at his feet as though I were dead, but he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid! I am the first and the last, <a name="1:18">1:18</a> and the one who lives! I was dead, but look, now I am alive—forever and ever—and I hold the keys of death and of Hades! <a name="1:19">1:19</a> Therefore write what you saw, what is, and what will be after these things. <a name="1:20">1:20</a> The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.</p> <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2> <h3 id="tothechurchinephesus">To the Church in Ephesus</h3> <p><a name="2:1">2:1</a> “To the angel of the church in Ephesus, write the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>“This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who has a firm grasp on the seven stars in his right hand—the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands: <a name="2:2">2:2</a> ‘I know your works as well as your labor and steadfast endurance, and that you cannot tolerate evil. You have even put to the test those who refer to themselves as apostles (but are not), and have discovered that they are false. <a name="2:3">2:3</a> I am also aware that you have persisted steadfastly, endured much for the sake of my name, and have not grown weary. <a name="2:4">2:4</a> But I have this against you: You have departed from your first love! <a name="2:5">2:5</a> Therefore, remember from what high state you have fallen and repent! Do the deeds you did at the first; if not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place—that is, if you do not repent. <a name="2:6">2:6</a> But you do have this going for you: You hate what the Nicolaitans practice—practices I also hate. <a name="2:7">2:7</a> The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

I also know the slander against you by those who call themselves Jews and really are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. <a name="2:10">2:10</a> Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. The devil is about to have some of you thrown into prison so you may be tested, and you will experience suffering for ten days. Remain faithful even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown that is life itself. <a name="2:11">2:11</a> The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will in no way be harmed by the second death.’</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="tothechurchinpergamum">To the Church in Pergamum</h3> <p><a name="2:12">2:12</a> “To the angel of the church in Pergamum write the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>“This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who has the sharp double-edged sword: <a name="2:13">2:13</a> ‘I know where you live—where Satan’s throne is. Yet you continue to cling to my name and you have not denied your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed in your city where Satan lives. <a name="2:14">2:14</a> But I have a few things against you: You have some people there who follow the teaching of Balaam, who instructed Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality. <a name="2:15">2:15</a> In the same way, there are also some among you who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans. <a name="2:16">2:16</a> Therefore, repent! If not, I will come against you quickly and make war against those people with the sword of my mouth. <a name="2:17">2:17</a> The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give him some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on that stone will be written a new name that no one can understand except the one who receives it.’</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="chapter18">Chapter 18</h2> <h3 id="babylonisdestroyed">Babylon is Destroyed</h3> <p><a name="18:1">18:1</a> After these things I saw another angel, who possessed great authority, coming down out of heaven, and the earth was lit up by his radiance. <a name="18:2">18:2</a> He shouted with a powerful voice:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great! She has become a lair for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detested beast. <a name="18:3">18:3</a> For all the nations have fallen from the wine of her immoral passion, and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have gotten rich from the power of her sensual behavior.”</p> </blockquote> <p><a name="18:4">18:4</a> Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, so you will not take part in her sins and so you will not receive her plagues, <a name="18:5">18:5</a> because her sins have piled up all the way to heaven and God has remembered her crimes. <a name="18:6">18:6</a> Repay her the same way she repaid others; pay her back double corresponding to her deeds. In the cup she mixed, mix double the amount for her. <a name="18:7">18:7</a> As much as she exalted herself and lived in sensual luxury, to this extent give her torment and grief because she said to herself, ‘I rule as queen and am no widow; I will never experience grief!’ <a name="18:8">18:8</a> For this reason, she will experience her plagues in a single day: disease, mourning, and famine, and she will be burned down with fire, because the Lord God who judges her is powerful!”</p> <h2 id="chapter20">Chapter 20</h2> <h3 id="thethousandyearreign">The Thousand Year Reign</h3> <p><a name="20:1">20:1</a> Then I saw an angel descending from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a huge chain. <a name="20:2">20:2</a> He seized the dragon—the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan—and tied him up for a thousand years. <a name="20:3">20:3</a> The angel then threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it so that he could not deceive the nations until the one thousand years were finished. (After these things he must be released for a brief period of time.)</p> <p><a name="20:4">20:4</a> Then I saw thrones and seated on them were those who had been given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. These had not worshiped the beast or his image and had refused to receive his mark on their forehead or hand. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. <a name="20:5">20:5</a> (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished.) This is the first resurrection. <a name="20:6">20:6</a> Blessed and holy is the one who takes part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.</p> <h3 id="satan’sfinaldefeat">Satan’s Final Defeat</h3> <p><a name="20:7">20:7</a> Now when the thousand years are finished, Satan will be released from his prison <a name="20:8">20:8</a> and will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to bring them together for the battle. They are as numerous as the grains of sand in the sea. <a name="20:9">20:9</a> They went up on the broad plain of the earth and encircled the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and devoured them completely. <a name="20:10">20:10</a> And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are too, and they will be tormented there day and night forever and ever.</p> <h3 id="thegreatwhitethrone">The Great White Throne</h3> <p><a name="20:11">20:11</a> Then I saw a large white throne and the one who was seated on it; the earth and the heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. <a name="20:12">20:12</a> And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne. Then books were opened, and another book was opened—the book of life. So the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to their deeds. <a name="20:13">20:13</a> The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each one was judged according to his deeds. <a name="20:14">20:14</a> Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire. <a name="20:15">20:15</a> If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, that person was thrown into the lake of fire.</p> <h2 id="chapter21">Chapter 21</h2> <h3 id="anewheavenandanewearth">A New Heaven and a New Earth</h3> <p><a name="21:1">21:1</a> Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and earth had ceased to exist, and the sea existed no more. <a name="21:2">21:2</a> And I saw the holy city—the new Jerusalem—descending out of heaven from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband. <a name="21:3">21:3</a> And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: “Look! The residence of God is among human beings. He will live among them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them. <a name="21:4">21:4</a> He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will not exist any more—or mourning, or crying, or pain, for the former things have ceased to exist.”</p> <h2 id="chapter22">Chapter 22</h2> <p><a name="22:1">22:1</a> Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life—water as clear as crystal—pouring out from the throne of God and of the Lamb, <a name="22:2">22:2</a> flowing down the middle of the city’s main street. On each side of the river is the tree of life producing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month of the year. Its leaves are for the healing of the nations. <a name="22:3">22:3</a> And there will no longer be any curse, and the throne of God and the Lamb will be in the city. His servants will worship him, <a name="22:4">22:4</a> and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. <a name="22:5">22:5</a> Night will be no more, and they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign forever and ever.</p> <h3 id="afinalreminder">A Final Reminder</h3> <p><a name="22:6">22:6</a> Then the angel said to me, “These words are reliable and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon.”</p> <blockquote> <p><a name="22:7">22:7</a> (Look! I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy expressed in this book.)</p> </blockquote> <p><a name="22:8">22:8</a> I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things, and when I heard and saw them, I threw myself down to worship at the feet of the angel who was showing them to me. <a name="22:9">22:9</a> But he said to me, “Do not do this! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets, and with those who obey the words of this book. Worship God!” <a name="22:10">22:10</a> Then he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy contained in this book, because the time is near. <a name="22:11">22:11</a> The evildoer must continue to do evil, and the one who is morally filthy must continue to be filthy. The one who is righteous must continue to act righteously, and the one who is holy must continue to be holy.”</p> <blockquote> <p><a name="22:12">22:12</a> (Look! I am coming soon, and my reward is with me to pay each one according to what he has done! <a name="22:13">22:13</a> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end!)</p> </blockquote> <p><a name="22:14">22:14</a> Blessed are those who wash their robes so they can have access to the tree of life and can enter into the city by the gates. <a name="22:15">22:15</a> Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral, and the murderers, and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood!</p> </div> </div> </div> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js?ckcachebust=591235827" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js?ckcachebust=591235827" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js?ckcachebust=591235827" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
