> <cite>1:1</cite> The vision that Obadiah saw:
> The Lord God says this concerning Edom.

### Edom’s Approaching Destruction

> We have heard a report from the Lord.
> An envoy was sent among the nations, saying,
> “Arise! Let us make war against Edom!”
> <cite>1:2</cite> The Lord says, “Look! I will make you a weak nation;
> you will be greatly despised!
> <cite>1:3</cite> Your presumptuous heart has deceived you—
> you who reside in the safety of the rocky cliffs,
> whose abode is high in the mountains.
> You think to yourself,
> ‘No one can bring me down to the ground!’
> <cite>1:4</cite> Even if you were to soar high like an eagle,
> even if you were to make your nest among the stars,
> even from there I can bring you down!” says the Lord.
> <cite>1:5</cite> “If thieves came to rob you during the night,
> they would steal only as much as appealed to them!
> If grape pickers came to harvest your vineyards,
> they would leave some behind for the poor!
> But you will be totally destroyed!
> <cite>1:6</cite> How the people of Esau will be thoroughly plundered!
> Their hidden valuables will be ransacked!
> <cite>1:7</cite> All your allies will force you from your homeland!
> Your treaty partners will deceive you and overpower you.
> Your trusted friends will set an ambush for you,
> which will take you by surprise!
> <cite>1:8</cite> In that day,” the Lord says,
> “I will destroy the wise sages of Edom!
> the advisers from Esau’s mountain!
> <cite>1:9</cite> Your warriors will be shattered, O Teman,
> so that everyone will be destroyed from Esau’s mountain!

### Edom’s Treachery Against Judah

> <cite>1:10</cite> “Because you violently slaughtered your relatives, the people of Jacob,
> shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed forever.
> <cite>1:11</cite> You stood aloof while strangers took his army captive,
> and foreigners advanced to his gates.
> When they cast lots over Jerusalem,
> you behaved as though you were in league with them.
> <cite>1:12</cite> You should not have gloated when your relatives suffered calamity.
> You should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah when they were destroyed.
> You should not have boasted when they suffered adversity.
> <cite>1:13</cite> You should not have entered the city of my people when they experienced distress.
> You should not have joined in gloating over their misfortune when they suffered distress.
> You should not have looted their wealth when they endured distress.
> <cite>1:14</cite> You should not have stood at the fork in the road to slaughter those escaping.
> You should not have captured their refugees when they suffered adversity.

### The Coming Day of the Lord

> <cite>1:15</cite> “For the day of the Lord is approaching for all the nations!
> Just as you have done, so it will be done to you.
> You will get exactly what your deeds deserve.
> <cite>1:16</cite> For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain,
> so all the nations will drink continually.
> They will drink, and they will gulp down;
> they will be as though they had never been.
> <cite>1:17</cite> But on Mount Zion there will be a remnant of those who escape,
> and it will be a holy place once again.
> The descendants of Jacob will conquer
> those who had conquered them.
> <cite>1:18</cite> The descendants of Jacob will be a fire,
> and the descendants of Joseph a flame.
> The descendants of Esau will be like stubble.
> They will burn them up and devour them.
> There will not be a single survivor of the descendants of Esau!”
> Indeed, the Lord has so spoken.
> <cite>1:19</cite> The people of the Negev will take possession of Esau’s mountain,
> and the people of the Shephelah will take possession of the land of the Philistines.
> They will also take possession of the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,
> and the people of Benjamin will take possession of Gilead.
> <cite>1:20</cite> The exiles of this fortress of the people of Israel
> will take possession of what belongs to the people of Canaan, as far as Zarephath,
> and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
> will take possession of the towns of the Negev.
> <cite>1:21</cite> Those who have been delivered will go up on Mount Zion
> in order to rule over Esau’s mountain.
> Then the Lord will reign as King!
