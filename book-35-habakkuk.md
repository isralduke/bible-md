## Chapter 1

### Habakkuk Complains to the Lord

<cite>1:1</cite> The following is the message which God revealed to Habakkuk the prophet:

> <cite>1:2</cite> How long, Lord, must I cry for help?
> But you do not listen!
> I call out to you, “Violence!”
> But you do not intervene!
> <cite>1:3</cite> Why do you force me to experience injustice?
> Why do you put up with wrongdoing?
> Destruction and violence confront me;
> conflict is present and one must endure strife.
> <cite>1:4</cite> For this reason the law lacks power,
> and justice is never carried out.
> Indeed, the wicked intimidate the innocent.
> For this reason justice is perverted.

### The Lord Reveals Some Startling News

> <cite>1:5</cite> “Look at the nations and pay attention!
> You will be shocked and amazed!
> For I will do something in your lifetime
> that you will not believe even though you are forewarned.
> <cite>1:6</cite> Look, I am about to empower the Babylonians,
> that ruthless and greedy nation.
> They sweep across the surface of the earth,
> seizing dwelling places that do not belong to them.
> <cite>1:7</cite> They are frightening and terrifying;
> they decide for themselves what is right.
> <cite>1:8</cite> Their horses are faster than leopards
> and more alert than wolves in the desert.
> Their horses gallop,
> their horses come a great distance;
> like a vulture they swoop down quickly to devour their prey.
> <cite>1:9</cite> All of them intend to do violence;
> every face is determined.
> They take prisoners as easily as one scoops up sand.
> <cite>1:10</cite> They mock kings
> and laugh at rulers.
> They laugh at every fortified city;
> they build siege ramps and capture them.
> <cite>1:11</cite> They sweep by like the wind and pass on.
> But the one who considers himself a god will be held guilty.”

### Habakkuk Voices Some Concerns

> <cite>1:12</cite> Lord, you have been active from ancient times;
> my sovereign God, you are immortal.
> Lord, you have made them your instrument of judgment.
> Protector, you have appointed them as your instrument of punishment.
> <cite>1:13</cite> You are too just to tolerate evil;
> you are unable to condone wrongdoing.
> So why do you put up with such treacherous people?
> Why do you say nothing when the wicked devour those who are relatively innocent?
> <cite>1:14</cite> You made people like fish in the sea,
> like animals in the sea that have no ruler.
> <cite>1:15</cite> The Babylonian tyrant pulls them all up with a fishhook;
> he hauls them in with his throw net.
> When he catches them in his dragnet,
> he is very happy.
> <cite>1:16</cite> Because of his success he offers sacrifices to his throw net
> and burns incense to his dragnet;
> for because of them he has plenty of food,
> and more than enough to eat.
> <cite>1:17</cite> Will he then continue to fill and empty his throw net?
> Will he always destroy nations and spare none?

## Chapter 2

> <cite>2:1</cite> I will stand at my watch post;
> I will remain stationed on the city wall.
> I will keep watching, so I can see what he says to me
> and can know how I should answer
> when he counters my argument.

### The Lord Assures Habakkuk

> <cite>2:2</cite> The Lord responded:
> “Write down this message! Record it legibly on tablets,
> so the one who announces it may read it easily.
> <cite>2:3</cite> For the message is a witness to what is decreed;
> it gives reliable testimony about how matters will turn out.
> Even if the message is not fulfilled right away, wait patiently;
> for it will certainly come to pass—it won’t be late arriving.
> <cite>2:4</cite> Look, the one whose desires are not upright will faint from exhaustion,
> but the person of integrity will live because of his faithfulness.
> <cite>2:5</cite> Indeed, wine will betray the proud, restless man!
> His appetite is as big as Sheol’s;
> like death, he is never satisfied.
> He grabs all the nations;
> he seizes all peoples.
> The Proud Babylonians are as Good as Dead
> <cite>2:6</cite> “But all these nations will someday taunt him
> and ridicule him with proverbial sayings:
> ‘The one who accumulates what does not belong to him is as good as dead (How long will this go on?)—
> he who gets rich by extortion!’
> <cite>2:7</cite> Your creditors will suddenly attack;
> those who terrify you will spring into action,
> and they will rob you.
> <cite>2:8</cite> Because you robbed many countries,
> all who are left among the nations will rob you.
> You have shed human blood
> and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.
> <cite>2:9</cite> The one who builds his house by unjust gain is as good as dead.
> He does this so he can build his nest way up high
> and escape the clutches of disaster.
> <cite>2:10</cite> Your schemes will bring shame to your house.
> Because you destroyed many nations, you will self-destruct.
> <cite>2:11</cite> For the stones in the walls will cry out,
> and the wooden rafters will answer back.
> <cite>2:12</cite> The one who builds a city by bloodshed is as good as dead—
> he who starts a town by unjust deeds.
> <cite>2:13</cite> Be sure of this! The Lord who leads armies has decreed:
> The nations’ efforts will go up in smoke;
> their exhausting work will be for nothing.
> <cite>2:14</cite> For recognition of the Lord’s sovereign majesty will fill the earth
> just as the waters fill up the sea.
> <cite>2:15</cite> “You who force your neighbor to drink wine are as good as dead—
> you who make others intoxicated by forcing them to drink from the bowl of your furious anger,
> so you can look at their genitals.
> <cite>2:16</cite> But you will become drunk with shame, not majesty.
> Now it is your turn to drink and expose your uncircumcised foreskin!
> The cup of wine in the Lord’s right hand is coming to you,
> and disgrace will replace your majestic glory!
> <cite>2:17</cite> For you will pay in full for your violent acts against Lebanon;
> terrifying judgment will come upon you because of the way you destroyed the wild animals living there.
> You have shed human blood
> and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.
> <cite>2:18</cite> What good is an idol? Why would a craftsman make it?
> What good is a metal image that gives misleading oracles?
> Why would its creator place his trust in it
> and make such mute, worthless things?
> <cite>2:19</cite> The one who says to wood, ‘Wake up!’ is as good as dead—
> he who says to speechless stone, ‘Awake!’
> Can it give reliable guidance?
> It is overlaid with gold and silver;
> it has no life’s breath inside it.
> <cite>2:20</cite> But the Lord is in his majestic palace.
> The whole earth is speechless in his presence!”

## Chapter 3

### Habakkuk’s Vision of the Divine Warrior

<cite>3:1</cite> This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet:

> <cite>3:2</cite> Lord, I have heard the report of what you did;
> I am awed, Lord, by what you accomplished.
> In our time repeat those deeds;
> in our time reveal them again.
> But when you cause turmoil, remember to show us mercy!
> <cite>3:3</cite> God comes from Teman,
> the sovereign one from Mount Paran. Selah.
> His splendor covers the skies,
> his glory fills the earth.
> <cite>3:4</cite> He is as bright as lightning;
> a two-pronged lightning bolt flashes from his hand.
> This is the outward display of his power.
> <cite>3:5</cite> Plague goes before him;
> pestilence marches right behind him.
> <cite>3:6</cite> He takes his battle position and shakes the earth;
> with a mere look he frightens the nations.
> The ancient mountains disintegrate;
> the primeval hills are flattened.
> He travels on the ancient roads.
> <cite>3:7</cite> I see the tents of Cushan overwhelmed by trouble;
> the tent curtains of the land of Midian are shaking.
> <cite>3:8</cite> Is the Lord mad at the rivers?
> Are you angry with the rivers?
> Are you enraged at the sea?
> Is this why you climb into your horse-drawn chariots,
> your victorious chariots?
> <cite>3:9</cite> Your bow is ready for action;
> you commission your arrows. Selah.
> You cause flash floods on the earth’s surface.
> <cite>3:10</cite> When the mountains see you, they shake.
> The torrential downpour sweeps through.
> The great deep shouts out;
> it lifts its hands high.
> <cite>3:11</cite> The sun and moon stand still in their courses;
> the flash of your arrows drives them away,
> the bright light of your lightning-quick spear.
> <cite>3:12</cite> You furiously stomp on the earth,
> you angrily trample down the nations.
> <cite>3:13</cite> You march out to deliver your people,
> to deliver your special servant.
> You strike the leader of the wicked nation,
> laying him open from the lower body to the neck. Selah.
> <cite>3:14</cite> You pierce the heads of his warriors with a spear.
> They storm forward to scatter us;
> they shout with joy as if they were plundering the poor with no opposition.
> <cite>3:15</cite> But you trample on the sea with your horses,
> on the surging, raging waters.

### Habakkuk Declares His Confidence

> <cite>3:16</cite> I listened and my stomach churned;
> the sound made my lips quiver.
> My frame went limp, as if my bones were decaying,
> and I shook as I tried to walk.
> I long for the day of distress
> to come upon the people who attack us.
> <cite>3:17</cite> When the fig tree does not bud,
> and there are no grapes on the vines;
> when the olive trees do not produce,
> and the fields yield no crops;
> when the sheep disappear from the pen,
> and there are no cattle in the stalls,
> <cite>3:18</cite> I will rejoice because of the Lord;
> I will be happy because of the God who delivers me.
> <cite>3:19</cite> The sovereign Lord is my source of strength.
> He gives me the agility of a deer;
> he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.
