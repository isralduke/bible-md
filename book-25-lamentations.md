### w (Vav)

> <cite>1:6</cite> Everything in which she had gloried

### j (Khet)

### m (Mem)

### r (Resh)

> the rest die of hunger inside their homes.

### ? (Sin/Shin)

### a (Alef)

> <cite>2:1</cite> Alas!

### d (Dalet)

> <cite>2:4</cite> Like an enemy he strung his archer’s bow;

> Your wound is as deep as the sea;
> no one can heal you!

### n (Nun)

> <cite>2:14</cite> The visions that your prophets proclaimed to you

### Jerusalem Speaks:

### r (Resh)

> <cite>2:20</cite> O Lord, think about it!

> <cite>3:5</cite> He has besieged and surrounded me
> with bitter hardship.
> <cite>3:6</cite> He has made me reside in intense darkness
> like those who died long ago.

### g (Gimel)

> <cite>3:7</cite> He has walled me in so that I cannot escape;
> he has weighed me down with heavy prison chains.
> <cite>3:8</cite> Even though I cry out desperately for help,
> he shuts his ears to my prayer.
> <cite>3:9</cite> He has blocked every road I take with a wall of fitted stones;
> he has made every path on which I flee impossible to traverse.

### d (Dalet)

> <cite>3:10</cite> He is like a bear lying in wait for me,
> like a hidden lion stalking its prey.
> <cite>3:11</cite> He dragged me from the path and tore me to pieces,
> and mangled me beyond rescue.
> <cite>3:12</cite> He drew his bow
> and made me the target for his arrows.

### h (He)

> <cite>3:13</cite> He shot his arrows
> into my heart.
> <cite>3:14</cite> I have become the laughingstock of all people;
> I am the subject of their mockery continually.
> <cite>3:15</cite> He has made me eat bitter herbs,
> and made me drink stagnant water.

### w (Vav)

> <cite>3:16</cite> He has broken my teeth with gravel;
> he has made me cower in ashes.
> <cite>3:17</cite> I am deprived of peace;
> I have forgotten what happiness is.
> <cite>3:18</cite> So I said, “My endurance has perished,
> I have lost all hope of deliverance from the Lord.”

### z (Zayin)

> <cite>3:19</cite> Just thinking about my impoverished and homeless condition
> is bitter poison.
> <cite>3:20</cite> When I continually think about this,
> I become emotionally depressed.
> <cite>3:21</cite> But this I call to mind,
> therefore I have hope:

### j (Khet)

> <cite>3:22</cite> The Lord’s many kindnesses never cease,
> for his great compassion never comes to an end.
> <cite>3:23</cite> They are renewed every morning;

> <cite>3:24</cite> I said to myself, “The Lord is the portion of my inheritance;

### f (Tet)

> <cite>3:25</cite> The Lord is good to those who trust in him,
> to the one who seeks him.
> <cite>3:26</cite> It is good to wait patiently

> <cite>3:27</cite> It is good for a man to bear the yoke
> while he is young.

### y (Yod)

> <cite>3:28</cite> Let a person sit alone in silence,
> when the Lord is disciplining him.
> <cite>3:29</cite> Let him bury his face in the dust;
> there may yet be hope.
> <cite>3:30</cite> Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him;
> let him have his fill of insults.

### k (Kaf)

> <cite>3:31</cite> For the Lord will not
> reject us forever.
> <cite>3:32</cite> Though he has caused us grief, he will have compassion on us,
> according to the abundance of his kindness.
> <cite>3:33</cite> For he does not enjoy bringing affliction
> nor causing grief to mortal men.

### l (Lamed)

> <cite>3:34</cite> To crush underfoot
> all the prisoners in the land,
> <cite>3:35</cite> to deprive a man of his rights
> in the presence of the Most High,
> <cite>3:36</cite> to subvert a man in his just cause—
> the Lord does not approve of such things!

### m (Mem)

> <cite>3:37</cite> Whose command was ever fulfilled
> unless the Lord had decreed it?
> <cite>3:38</cite> Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes—
> both calamity and blessings?
> <cite>3:39</cite> Why should any living man complain
> when he is punished for his sins?

### n (Nun)

> <cite>3:40</cite> Let us carefully examine our ways,
> and let us return to the Lord.
> <cite>3:41</cite> Let us lift up our hearts and our hands

> <cite>3:42</cite> “We have sinned rebelliously;
> you have not forgiven.”

### s (Samek)

> <cite>3:43</cite> You have clothed yourself with anger and pursued us;
> you have slaughtered us without pity.
> <cite>3:44</cite> You have hidden yourself in a cloud
> so that no prayer can pass through.
> <cite>3:45</cite> You have made us like filthy excrement
> in the estimation of the nations.

### p (Pe)

> <cite>3:46</cite> All our enemies brashly proclaim threats
> against us.
> <cite>3:47</cite> Panic and pitfall have come upon us,
> devastation and destruction.
> <cite>3:48</cite> Streams of tears flow from my eyes
> because my people are destroyed.

### u (Ayin)

> <cite>3:49</cite> Tears flow from my eyes unceasingly;
> they will not stop
> <cite>3:50</cite> until the Lord looks down
> from heaven and sees what has happened.
> <cite>3:51</cite> What my eyes see causes grief to me
> on account of the abuse of all the women in my city.

### x (Tsade)

> <cite>3:52</cite> For no good reason, my enemies
> have hunted me down like a bird.
> <cite>3:53</cite> They have tried to end my life in a pit,
> by throwing stones on me.
> <cite>3:54</cite> The waters closed over my head,
> I thought that I was about to die.

### q (Qof)

> <cite>3:55</cite> I called on your name, O Lord,
> from the depths of the pit.
> <cite>3:56</cite> You heard my plea:
> “Do not close your ears to my cry for help!”
> <cite>3:57</cite> You came near when I called to you;
> you said, “Do not fear!”

### r (Resh)

> <cite>3:58</cite> You championed my cause, O Lord;
> you redeemed my life.
> <cite>3:59</cite> You have seen the wrong done to me, O Lord;
> may you issue judgment on my behalf!
> <cite>3:60</cite> You have seen all their vengeance,
> all their plots against me.

### ? (Sin/Shin)

> <cite>3:61</cite> You have heard their taunts, O Lord,
> all their plots against me.
> <cite>3:62</cite> My assailants revile and conspire
> against me all day long.
> <cite>3:63</cite> Look at them! From morning to evening
> I am the object of their mocking songs.

### t (Tav)

> <cite>3:64</cite> Pay them back what they deserve, O Lord,
> according to what they have done.
> <cite>3:65</cite> Render their hearts hard;

### g (Gimel)

> <cite>4:3</cite> Even the jackals nurse their young
> at their breast;
> but my people have become cruel
> like ostriches in the desert.

### d (Dalet)

### h (He)

> <cite>4:5</cite> Those who once feasted on delicacies

### l (Lamed)

> <cite>4:12</cite> Neither the kings of the foreign nations

### n (Nun)

### s (Samek)

> <cite>4:15</cite> Men cry to them, “Stay away! You are unclean!”

### The Prophet Speaks:

### ? (Sin/Shin)

> we are physically worn out and cannot find any rest.
> <cite>5:6</cite> We have made treaties with Egypt and Assyria

> so we are left to bear their punishment.
> <cite>5:8</cite> Tyrants rule over us;
> there is no one to rescue us from their control.
> <cite>5:9</cite> We risk our lives when we search for food
> because murderous marauders lurk in the countryside.
> <cite>5:10</cite> Our skin is hot as an oven;
> we are feverish from hunger.
> <cite>5:11</cite> Our wives have been raped in the City of Zion;
