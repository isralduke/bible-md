## Chapter 1

### א (Alef)

> <a>1:1</a> Alas!
> The city once full of people
> now sits all alone!
> She who was once prominent among the nations
> has become a widow!
> The princess who once ruled over the provinces
> has become a forced laborer!

### ב (Bet)

> <a>1:2</a> She weeps bitterly at night;
> tears stream down her cheeks.
> There is no one to comfort her
> among all her former lovers.
> All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;
> they have become her enemies.

### ג (Gimel)

> <a>1:3</a> The people of Judah have gone into exile under affliction
> and under harsh oppression.
> They now live in other nations,
> but find no rest.
> All who pursued them have overtaken them
> in narrow straits.

### ד (Dalet)

> <a>1:4</a> The roads leading to Zion are in mourning,
> because no one travels down their paths to celebrate the festivals.
> All her city gates are deserted;
> her priests groan in grief.
> Her virgins are filled with sorrow;
> Jerusalem is in bitter anguish!

### ה (He)

> <a>1:5</a> Her foes subjugated her;
> her enemies plundered her possessions.
> For the Lord afflicted her
> because of her many acts of rebellion.
> Her children were driven away
> as prisoners before the enemy.

### ו (Vav)

> <a>1:6</a> Everything in which she had gloried
> has been taken away from Zion.
> Her leaders were like deer
> who could not find any hiding place;
> they were too exhausted to flee
> from the hunter.

### ז (Zayin)

> <a>1:7</a> Jerusalem remembers,
> when she became a poor homeless person,
> all the treasures—possessions that
> belonged to her in days of old.
> When her people fell into the grasp of the enemy,
> none of her allies came to her rescue.
> Her enemies gloat over her;
> they laughed contemptuously at her downfall.

### ח (Khet)

> <a>1:8</a> Jerusalem has committed heinous sin;
> therefore, she has become an object of scorn.
> All who once respected her now despise her,
> because they have seen her nakedness.
> She herself groans aloud
> and turns away in shame.

### ט (Tet)

> <a>1:9</a> Her menstrual filth has soiled her own clothing;
> she did not consider the consequences of her sin.
> Her demise occurred in an astonishing way,
> and there was no one to comfort her.
> She cried, “Look, O Lord, on my affliction,
> because my enemy boasts!”

### י (Yod)

> <a>1:10</a> The enemy seized
> all her valuable possessions.
> She watched in horror as Gentiles invaded her holy temple,
> whom you had forbidden:
> “They may not enter your assembly place.”

### כ (Kaf)

> <a>1:11</a> All her former inhabitants groan
> as they search for a morsel of bread.
> They are forced to sell their prized possessions
> just to purchase enough food
> to keep themselves alive.
> Jerusalem Speaks:
> Look, O Lord!
> Consider that I have become worthless!

### ל (Lamed)

> <a>1:12</a> O you who pass by on the road,
> is it nothing to you?
> Consider and see:
> Is there any pain like my pain?
> The Lord brought it on me;
> he inflicted it on me when he burned with anger.

### מ (Mem)

> <a>1:13</a> He sent down fierce fire into my bones,
> and it prevailed against them.
> He stretched a trapper’s net to ensnare my feet;
> he made me turn back.
> He made me desolate,
> sick all day long.

### נ (Nun)

> <a>1:14</a> My sins are bound around my neck like a yoke,
> they are lashed tight together by his hand.
> He has placed his yoke on my neck;
> he has made me weak.
> The Lord has handed me over
> to those whom I am powerless to resist.

### ס (Samek)

> <a>1:15</a> The Lord has hurled all my valiant warriors
> out of my midst.
> He summoned a legal assembly against me
> to crush my young warriors.
> As in a wine press, the Lord has trampled down
> the virgin daughter of Judah.

### ע (Ayin)

> <a>1:16</a> I weep on account of these things;
> my eyes flow with tears.
> For there is no one to comfort me anywhere near,
> no one who could encourage me.
> My inhabitants are desolated
> because the enemy has prevailed.
> The Prophet Speaks:

### פ (Pe)

> <a>1:17</a> Zion spread out her hands,
> but there is no one to comfort her.
> The Lord has issued a decree against Jacob:
> The nations that surround him will become his enemies.
> They treat Jerusalem
> like filthy garbage in their midst.

### Jerusalem Speaks:

### צ (Tsade)

> <a>1:18</a> The Lord is right to judge me!
> For I rebelled against his commands.
> Listen, all you peoples,
> and behold my suffering!
> My young men and women
> have been taken prisoner into exile.

### ק (Qof)

> <a>1:19</a> I called for my lovers,
> but they deceived me.
> My priests and my elders died of hunger in the city,
> while searching for food that might have kept them alive.

### ר (Resh)

> <a>1:20</a> Look, O Lord, because I am in distress,
> my stomach is in knots!
> My heart is turning over inside me,
> because I know how terribly rebellious I had been!
> In the street the sword bereaves a mother of her children;
> the rest die of hunger inside their homes.

### ש (Sin/Shin)

> <a>1:21</a> They have heard that I groan,
> yet there is no one to comfort me.
> All my enemies have heard of my trouble;
> they are glad that you have brought it about.
> May you bring about the time of judgment that you promised,
> so that they may be judged like me!

### ת (Tav)

> <a>1:22</a> Let all their wickedness come before you;
> may you deal with them
> just as you have dealt with me,
> because of all my acts of rebellion.
> For my groans are many,
> and my heart is full of sorrow.
> The Prophet Speaks:

## Chapter 2

### א (Alef)

> <a>2:1</a> Alas!
> The Lord has covered Zion
> with the cloud of his anger!
> He has thrown down the splendor of Israel
> from heaven to earth;
> he did not protect the temple
> when he displayed his anger.

### ב (Bet)

> <a>2:2</a> The Lord has destroyed all the homes of Jacob’s descendants;
> and he has shown no mercy.
> In his wrath he has torn down
> every fortified city in Judah.
> He has toppled the kingdom and its rulers,
> putting them to shame.

### ג (Gimel)

> <a>2:3</a> In his fierce anger he destroyed
> the whole army of Israel.
> He withdrew his protection
> when the advancing enemy army attacked.
> He was like a raging fire burning up the land of Jacob’s descendants;
> it consumed everything around it.

### ד (Dalet)

> <a>2:4</a> Like an enemy he strung his archer’s bow;
> his right hand was ready to shoot.
> Like a foe he has slain
> all our vigorous young men;
> he has poured out his wrath like fire
> on the tents of Zion.

### ה (He)

> <a>2:5</a> The Lord was like an enemy;
> he has devastated Israel.
> He has devastated all its palaces
> and has destroyed its fortified cities.
> He made everyone in Judah
> mourn and lament.

### ו (Vav)

> <a>2:6</a> He has laid waste his temple like a vineyard;
> he has destroyed his appointed meeting place.
> The Lord has made it impossible for the city of Zion
> to celebrate the appointed festivals and Sabbaths.
> In his fierce anger he has rejected
> Judah’s king and priests.

### ז (Zayin)

> <a>2:7</a> The Lord has rejected his altar
> and has abandoned his temple.
> He allowed the enemy to capture
> the fortified palaces in Jerusalem;
> the enemy shouted in celebration in the temple of the Lord,
> like on the day appointed to celebrate a religious feast.

### ח (Khet)

> <a>2:8</a> The Lord was determined to tear down
> the walls around the city of Zion.
> He marked out the walls of Jerusalem for destruction,
> and he did not relent until they were destroyed.
> He made the ramparts and fortified walls lament;
> both of them mourned their destruction.

### ט (Tet)

> <a>2:9</a> The city gates have fallen down to the ground;
> the bars that lock the gates have been smashed to pieces.
> Jerusalem’s king and princes were taken into exile in other countries;
> there is no longer any guidance available.
> As for her prophets,
> they can no longer obtain a vision from the Lord.

### י (Yod)

> <a>2:10</a> The elders of the city of Zion
> sit on the ground in silence;
> they have thrown ashes on their heads;
> they clothed themselves with sackcloth.
> The young single women of Jerusalem
> stare down at the ground in grief.

### כ (Kaf)

> <a>2:11</a> My eyes are worn out because of all my tears;
> my stomach is in knots.
> My bile is poured out on the ground,
> because of the destruction of my beloved Jerusalem,
> because infants and newborn babies faint from hunger
> in the streets of the city.

### ל (Lamed)

> <a>2:12</a> Children cry out to their mothers
> for food and drink.
> Then they lose consciousness like a wounded warrior
> in the streets of the city.
> Then they die slowly
> in the arms of their mothers.

### מ (Mem)

> <a>2:13</a> With what can I equate you?
> To what can I compare you, O Jerusalem?
> To what can I liken you,
> so that I might comfort you, O City of Zion?
> Your wound is as deep as the sea;
> no one can heal you!

### נ (Nun)

> <a>2:14</a> The visions that your prophets proclaimed to you
> were empty lies;
> they failed to expose your sin,
> thus delivering you from exile.
> They proclaimed oracles to you
> that were false deceptions.

### ס (Samek)

> <a>2:15</a> All who pass by you on the road
> clap their hands to mock you;
> they sneer and shake their heads
> at Jerusalem:
> “Ha! This is the city whose former inhabitants said,
> ‘It is perfect in beauty,
> the source of joy to the whole earth!’”

### פ (Pe)

> <a>2:16</a> All your enemies
> jeer at you.
> They sneer and gnash their teeth;
> they say, “We have destroyed her!
> Ha! We have waited a long time for this day!
> We have actually lived to see it!”

### ע (Ayin)

> <a>2:17</a> The Lord has done what he planned;
> he has fulfilled his promise
> which he threatened to do long ago:
> He has overthrown you without mercy.
> He has allowed the enemy to gloat over you;
> he has enabled your adversaries to boast about their military might.

### צ (Tsade)

> <a>2:18</a> Cry out earnestly to the Lord,
> O Wall of Zion!
> Let your tears flow like a river
> from dawn to dusk!
> Do not allow yourself any rest;
> do not let your tears stop!

### ק (Qof)

> <a>2:19</a> Get up! Cry out for help in the night
> at the beginning of the night watches!
> Pour out your laments like water
> before the presence of the Lord!
> Lift up your hands to him
> on behalf of the lives of your children,
> who are dying from hunger
> at every street corner.

### Jerusalem Speaks:

### ר (Resh)

> <a>2:20</a> O Lord, think about it!
> Whom have you ever treated like this?
> Should women cannibalize the children they have borne,
> perfectly healthy newborn infants?
> Should priest and prophet be killed
> in the sanctuary of the Lord?

### ש (Sin/Shin)

> <a>2:21</a> The young and old lie dead together
> in the dust of the streets;
> the young men and single young women of Jerusalem
> have fallen by the sword.
> You killed them when you were angry;
> you slaughtered them without pity.

### ת (Tav)

> <a>2:22</a> You invited, as though on an appointed festival day,
> enemies to terrify me on every side.
> When the Lord became angry,
> no one escaped or survived.
> The perfectly healthy children whom I bore and raised,
> my enemy has destroyed.
> The Prophet Speaks:

## Chapter 3

### א (Alef)

> <a>3:1</a> I am the man who has experienced affliction
> from the disciplining rod of his wrath.
> <a>3:2</a> He has driven me into captivity,
> and made me walk in deep darkness.
> <a>3:3</a> He repeatedly attacked me
> over and over, continually.

### ב (Bet)

> <a>3:4</a> He has caused my mortal skin to waste away;
> he has broken my bones.
> <a>3:5</a> He has besieged and surrounded me
> with bitter hardship.
> <a>3:6</a> He has made me reside in intense darkness
> like those who died long ago.

### ג (Gimel)

> <a>3:7</a> He has walled me in so that I cannot escape;
> he has weighed me down with heavy prison chains.
> <a>3:8</a> Even though I cry out desperately for help,
> he shuts his ears to my prayer.
> <a>3:9</a> He has blocked every road I take with a wall of fitted stones;
> he has made every path on which I flee impossible to traverse.

### ד (Dalet)

> <a>3:10</a> He is like a bear lying in wait for me,
> like a hidden lion stalking its prey.
> <a>3:11</a> He dragged me from the path and tore me to pieces,
> and mangled me beyond rescue.
> <a>3:12</a> He drew his bow
> and made me the target for his arrows.

### ה (He)

> <a>3:13</a> He shot his arrows
> into my heart.
> <a>3:14</a> I have become the laughingstock of all people;
> I am the subject of their mockery continually.
> <a>3:15</a> He has made me eat bitter herbs,
> and made me drink stagnant water.

### ו (Vav)

> <a>3:16</a> He has broken my teeth with gravel;
> he has made me cower in ashes.
> <a>3:17</a> I am deprived of peace;
> I have forgotten what happiness is.
> <a>3:18</a> So I said, “My endurance has perished,
> I have lost all hope of deliverance from the Lord.”

### ז (Zayin)

> <a>3:19</a> Just thinking about my impoverished and homeless condition
> is bitter poison.
> <a>3:20</a> When I continually think about this,
> I become emotionally depressed.
> <a>3:21</a> But this I call to mind,
> therefore I have hope:

### ח (Khet)

> <a>3:22</a> The Lord’s many kindnesses never cease,
> for his great compassion never comes to an end.
> <a>3:23</a> They are renewed every morning;
> your faithfulness is abundant!
> <a>3:24</a> I said to myself, “The Lord is the portion of my inheritance;
> therefore, I will put my hope in him.”

### ט (Tet)

> <a>3:25</a> The Lord is good to those who trust in him,
> to the one who seeks him.
> <a>3:26</a> It is good to wait patiently
> for deliverance to come from the Lord.
> <a>3:27</a> It is good for a man to bear the yoke
> while he is young.

### י (Yod)

> <a>3:28</a> Let a person sit alone in silence,
> when the Lord is disciplining him.
> <a>3:29</a> Let him bury his face in the dust;
> there may yet be hope.
> <a>3:30</a> Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him;
> let him have his fill of insults.

### כ (Kaf)

> <a>3:31</a> For the Lord will not
> reject us forever.
> <a>3:32</a> Though he has caused us grief, he will have compassion on us,
> according to the abundance of his kindness.
> <a>3:33</a> For he does not enjoy bringing affliction
> nor causing grief to mortal men.

### ל (Lamed)

> <a>3:34</a> To crush underfoot
> all the prisoners in the land,
> <a>3:35</a> to deprive a man of his rights
> in the presence of the Most High,
> <a>3:36</a> to subvert a man in his just cause—
> the Lord does not approve of such things!

### מ (Mem)

> <a>3:37</a> Whose command was ever fulfilled
> unless the Lord had decreed it?
> <a>3:38</a> Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes—
> both calamity and blessings?
> <a>3:39</a> Why should any living man complain
> when he is punished for his sins?

### נ (Nun)

> <a>3:40</a> Let us carefully examine our ways,
> and let us return to the Lord.
> <a>3:41</a> Let us lift up our hearts and our hands
> to God in heaven:
> <a>3:42</a> “We have sinned rebelliously;
> you have not forgiven.”

### ס (Samek)

> <a>3:43</a> You have clothed yourself with anger and pursued us;
> you have slaughtered us without pity.
> <a>3:44</a> You have hidden yourself in a cloud
> so that no prayer can pass through.
> <a>3:45</a> You have made us like filthy excrement
> in the estimation of the nations.

### פ (Pe)

> <a>3:46</a> All our enemies brashly proclaim threats
> against us.
> <a>3:47</a> Panic and pitfall have come upon us,
> devastation and destruction.
> <a>3:48</a> Streams of tears flow from my eyes
> because my people are destroyed.

### ע (Ayin)

> <a>3:49</a> Tears flow from my eyes unceasingly;
> they will not stop
> <a>3:50</a> until the Lord looks down
> from heaven and sees what has happened.
> <a>3:51</a> What my eyes see causes grief to me
> on account of the abuse of all the women in my city.

### צ (Tsade)

> <a>3:52</a> For no good reason, my enemies
> have hunted me down like a bird.
> <a>3:53</a> They have tried to end my life in a pit,
> by throwing stones on me.
> <a>3:54</a> The waters closed over my head,
> I thought that I was about to die.

### ק (Qof)

> <a>3:55</a> I called on your name, O Lord,
> from the depths of the pit.
> <a>3:56</a> You heard my plea:
> “Do not close your ears to my cry for help!”
> <a>3:57</a> You came near when I called to you;
> you said, “Do not fear!”

### ר (Resh)

> <a>3:58</a> You championed my cause, O Lord;
> you redeemed my life.
> <a>3:59</a> You have seen the wrong done to me, O Lord;
> may you issue judgment on my behalf!
> <a>3:60</a> You have seen all their vengeance,
> all their plots against me.

### ש (Sin/Shin)

> <a>3:61</a> You have heard their taunts, O Lord,
> all their plots against me.
> <a>3:62</a> My assailants revile and conspire
> against me all day long.
> <a>3:63</a> Look at them! From morning to evening
> I am the object of their mocking songs.

### ת (Tav)

> <a>3:64</a> Pay them back what they deserve, O Lord,
> according to what they have done.
> <a>3:65</a> Render their hearts hard;
> may your curse be on them!
> <a>3:66</a> Pursue them in anger and eradicate them
> from under heaven, which belongs to you, O Lord!

## Chapter 4

### The Prophet Speaks:

### א (Alef)

> <a>4:1</a> Alas!
> The gold has lost its luster;
> the solid gold objects have lost their shine!
> The sacred gems are scattered
> at every street corner.

### ב (Bet)

> <a>4:2</a> The precious sons of Zion
> were once worth their weight in gold.
> Alas! Now they are no more valued than broken clay potsherds
> made by a potter.

### ג (Gimel)

> <a>4:3</a> Even the jackals nurse their young
> at their breast;
> but my people have become cruel
> like ostriches in the desert.

### ד (Dalet)

> <a>4:4</a> The infant’s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth
> due to thirst;
> Little children beg for food,
> but no one has even any bread to give to them.

### ה (He)

> <a>4:5</a> Those who once feasted on delicacies
> are now starving to death in the streets.
> Those who grew up wearing expensive clothes
> are now dying on the ash heaps.

### ו (Vav)

> <a>4:6</a> The punishment of my people
> is greater than the punishment of Sodom,
> which was overthrown in a moment
> and no one lifted a hand to help her.

### ז (Zayin)

> <a>4:7</a> Her princes were brighter than snow,
> whiter than milk;
> their bodies more ruddy than rubies;
> their appearance was like sapphires.

### ח (Khet)

> <a>4:8</a> Now their appearance is darker than soot;
> no one even recognizes who they are in the streets.
> Their skin has shriveled on their bones;
> it has become dry like wood.

### ט (Tet)

> <a>4:9</a> Those who were killed by the sword are better off
> than those who die of hunger;
> they waste away,
> struck down by lack of food.

### י (Yod)

> <a>4:10</a> With their own hands, tenderhearted women
> have cooked their own children,
> who became their food
> when my people were destroyed.

### כ (Kaf)

> <a>4:11</a> The Lord has fully vented his wrath;
> he has poured out his fierce anger.
> He kindled a fire in Zion
> which destroyed the very foundation stones of the city walls.

### ל (Lamed)

> <a>4:12</a> Neither the kings of the foreign nations
> nor the people of the lands ever thought it possible
> that enemy or foe could ever conquer
> the city of Jerusalem.

### מ (Mem)

> <a>4:13</a> But it happened because of the sins of her prophets
> and the iniquities of her priests,
> who unjustly killed the righteous
> within the city.

### נ (Nun)

> <a>4:14</a> Now they wander blindly through the streets,
> ritually defiled with the blood they shed,
> so that no one dares
> to touch their garments.

### ס (Samek)

> <a>4:15</a> Men cry to them, “Stay away! You are unclean!”
> “Stay away! Go away! Don’t touch us!”
> So they have fled and wander about;
> but the nations say, “They may not stay with us here any longer.”

### פ (Pe)

> <a>4:16</a> The Lord himself has scattered them;
> he no longer watches over them.
> The priests will not be shown consideration,
> the elders will not be spared.
> The People of Jerusalem Lament:

### ע (Ayin)

> <a>4:17</a> Our eyes continually failed us,
> as we looked in vain for help.
> From our watchtowers we watched expectantly
> for a nation that could not rescue us.

### צ (Tsade)

> <a>4:18</a> Our enemies hunted us down at every step;
> we could not even walk about publicly in our streets.
> Our end drew near, our days were numbered,
> for our end had come!

### ק (Qof)

> <a>4:19</a> Those who pursued us were swifter
> than vultures in the sky.
> They chased us over the mountains;
> they set an ambush for us in the wilderness.

### ר (Resh)

> <a>4:20</a> Our very life breath—the king anointed by the Lord—
> was caught in their traps.
> We thought that under his protection
> we would survive among the nations.

### The Prophet Speaks:

### ש (Sin/Shin)

> <a>4:21</a> Rejoice and be glad for now, O people of Edom,
> you who reside in the land of Uz.
> But the wine cup of judgment will be passed to you also;
> you will become drunk and strip yourself naked.

### ת (Tav)

> <a>4:22</a> O people of Zion, your punishment will eventually come to an end;
> he will not prolong your exile.
> But, O people of Edom, he will punish your sin
> and reveal your treachery!

## Chapter 5

### The People of Jerusalem Pray:

> <a>5:1</a> O Lord, consider what has happened to us;
> please pay attention and take notice of the disgrace we are suffering.
> <a>5:2</a> Strangers have taken possession of the land that we inherited,
> foreigners now occupy our homes.
> <a>5:3</a> We have become orphans and fatherless,
> our mothers have become widows.
> <a>5:4</a> We must pay money to drink our own water;
> we must buy our own wood at a steep price.
> <a>5:5</a> We are pursued—our adversaries are breathing down our necks;
> we are physically worn out and cannot find any rest.
> <a>5:6</a> We have made treaties with Egypt and Assyria
> just to acquire enough food to keep us alive.
> <a>5:7</a> Our ancestors sinned and are now dead,
> so we are left to bear their punishment.
> <a>5:8</a> Tyrants rule over us;
> there is no one to rescue us from their control.
> <a>5:9</a> We risk our lives when we search for food
> because murderous marauders lurk in the countryside.
> <a>5:10</a> Our skin is hot as an oven;
> we are feverish from hunger.
> <a>5:11</a> Our wives have been raped in the City of Zion;
> our virgin daughters have been ravished in the towns of Judah.
